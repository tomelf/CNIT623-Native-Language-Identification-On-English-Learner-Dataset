          <p>"Shopping is not always enjoyable".</p>
          <p>Before we can give our opinions on this <NS type="S"><i>statemant</i><c>statement</c></NS> we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS>.</p>
          <p>'Shopping' <NS type="RV"><i>stands for</i><c>means</c></NS> buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about <NS type="S"><i>luxuary</i><c>luxury</c></NS> goods.</p>
          <p>In this <NS type="RN"><i>contest</i><c>context</c></NS>, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> it as a duty. But if you realize how important <NS type="UT"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>is for your health what you buy</i><c>what you buy is for your health</c></NS> you will go shopping with <NS type="R"><i>much more</i><c>a far greater</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>consiousness</i><c>consciousness</c></NS> and <NS type="MQ"><c>more</c></NS> joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your <NS type="RN"><i>behaviour of</i><c>approach to</c></NS> shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> and use e-business and <NS type="RP"><i>online-shopping</i><c>online shopping</c></NS> to order your pants for example.</p>
          <p>This is even <NS type="RJ"><i>an appropriate</i><c>a good</c></NS> way to get around <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>before</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>have ordered</i><c>order</c></NS> them by e-mail! Another <NS type="RN"><i>solution</i><c>way</c></NS> to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.</p>
          <p>You have been presented <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> some <NS type="RN"><i>causes</i><c>reasons</c></NS> why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of <NS type="R"><i>behaviour to make more fun of it</i><c>making it more fun</c></NS>. It depends on every individual to change your mind and <NS type="RV"><i>act</i><c>behave</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> a 'smart' shopper.</p>
