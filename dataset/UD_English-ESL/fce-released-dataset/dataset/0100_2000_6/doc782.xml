          <p>I am writing in reply to your letter, which I <NS type="TV"><i>have received</i><c>received</c></NS> last week, and in fact I am very surprised and <NS type="DJ"><i>please</i><c>pleased</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the prize.</p>
          <p>First of all I would like to travel in July because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is my <NS type="MY"><c>only</c></NS> free month<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> since I am student and I am very busy <NS type="UT"><i>during</i></NS> all year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a <NS type="RJ"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabin, <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> I used to use <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent on holiday and I haven't <NS type="R">got very good experiences</NS>.</p>
          <p>Thirdly I chose photography and swimming because I have previous experience in these activities and of course I have some diplomas which I will send you.</p>
          <p>In addition, I work every summer as a <NS type="RN">Monitor</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the leisure centre in my town.</p>
          <p>Apart from this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> photography is one of my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> hobbies and I usually <NS type="TV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> nearly all my spare time <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>doing</c></NS> it and of course I have some diplomas as well.</p>
          <p>Lastly I would like to ask you <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> some questions.</p>
          <p><NS type="U"><i>On the one hand</i></NS> I would like to have further information about <NS type="RQ"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> kind of clothes I need for that area. I don't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both <NS type="M"><c>light and heavy clothes</c></NS>.</p>
          <p><NS type="U"><i>On the other hand</i></NS> I would like to request <NS type="R"><i>all details of</i><c>some information about</c></NS> accommodation and if you could <NS type="S"><i>specifie</i><c>specify</c></NS> what this trip includes, since I need to know how much money I have to take.</p>
          <p>I look forward to receiving a prompt reply.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully</p>
