          <p>the lost wallet</p>
          <p>A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first <NS type="RN"><i>pay</i><c>paycheque</c></NS> and went to a shopping center to spend my money <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> my credit card. I bought everything I wanted.</p>
          <p><NS type="DY"><i>Finaly</i><c>Finally</c></NS> the day to pay my credit card <NS type="TV"><i>arrives</i><c>arrived</c></NS> and where was my money? I started to look <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> everywhere. <NS type="TV"><i>I've asked</i><c>I asked</c></NS> my mom and my friends and <NS type="X"><i>everybody didn't know</i><c>nobody knew</c></NS> where it was. My mom said:</p>
          <p>'<NS type="TV"><i>You've told</i><c>You told</c></NS> me that you were going to put it in your wallet.'</p>
          <p>I started to look for my wallet and I couldn't find it, <NS type="R">lighter</NS>. Now I was without my money and my wallet. What could I do?</p>
          <p>Suddenly the door bell rang. I went to see who was there. It was <NS type="SX"><i>and</i><c>an</c></NS> old woman asking who <NS type="W"><i>was Maria</i><c>Maria was</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>'<NS type="RA"><i>It's</i><c>That's</c></NS> me!' I said.</p>
          <p>That's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the <NS type="SX"><i>sit</i><c>seat</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN">eating-place</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the shopping center that I went <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> that day!</p>
