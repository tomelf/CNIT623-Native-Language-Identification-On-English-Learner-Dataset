          <p>Dear Ms. Ryan,</p>
          <p>It was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> wonderful surprise when I received your letter. Thank you very much for this great opportunity. Now, I am writing this letter to reply <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> your questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only in July, which is the only month I can take holiday from my work.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try.</p>
          <p>Regarding <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports. However, I enjoy singing. I used to <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>belong to</c></NS> the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> hobbies.</p>
          <p>I normally <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>blushes</i><c>brushes</c></NS>, paints and paper instead of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> camera when I travel.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to ask you <NS type="S"><i>wheather</i><c>whether</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>there is</c></NS> anything I should bring <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> such as specific clothes, extra money etc.</p>
          <p>I look forward to receiving your reply.</p>
          <p><NS type="L"><i>Yours sincerely,</i><c>Yours faithfully</c></NS></p>

          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a <NS type="S"><i>privelage</i><c>privilege</c></NS> to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of "the Rolling Stones"! I did various things for them.</p>
          <p>At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made.</p>
          <p> Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just <NS type="FV"><i>turning</i><c>turn</c></NS> the volume up and down following <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the musician's instruction.</p>
          <p>My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get <NS type="S"><i>jelous</i><c>jealous</c></NS>. This was the best experience. I could give the members "Shiatsu massage" just before the concert to make them relax!! Can you imagine how much I appreciated that I am qualified in massage?</p>
          <p>Well, Kim, I have to go now. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
          <p>Love,</p>
