          <p>DEAR MS. RYAN,</p>
          <p> IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT. I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE <NS type="S"><i>WONNER</i><c>winner</c></NS> OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH. IT IS VERY <NS type="RJ"><i>PLEASED</i><c>PLEASING</c></NS> TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA, WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE.</p>
          <p>ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME, <NS type="UP"><i>ACCOMMODATION'S</i><c>ACCOMMODATION</c></NS> PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO. ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY. THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER. WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS <NS type="R"><i>WHOLE</i><c>FOR THE WHOLE OF</c></NS> AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY.</p>
          <p>CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS <NS type="ID">IN THE MEANTIME</NS> I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE <NS type="RT"><i>AT</i><c>OVER</c></NS> ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE <NS type="IV"><i>CHOOSEN</i><c>CHOSEN</c></NS> TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.</p>

          <p>SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE.</p>
          <p>PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING (<NS type="S"><i>ASPECIALLY</i><c>ESPECIALLY</c></NS> IN POLAND, WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE <NS type="S"><i>HIPERMARKETS</i><c>HYPERMARKETS</c></NS> AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS, <NS type="RN"><i>MOTORS</i><c>MOTORBIKES</c></NS> OR COMPUTERS. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF <NS type="FN"><i>FAMILIES</i><c>FAMILY</c></NS> (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST).</p>
          <p>BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>FROM</c></NS> CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR <NS type="UP"><i>GIRL-FRIENDS</i><c>GIRLFRIENDS</c></NS>. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO <NS type="RV"><i>SEAT</i><c>SIT</c></NS> AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER <NS type="UN"><i>REALISATION</i></NS>. PEOPLE<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>FOR</c></NS> THIS <NS type="AGN"><i>SITUATIONS</i><c>SITUATION</c></NS> (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE <NS type="DN"><i>SHOP-ASSISTANCE</i><c>SHOP ASSISTANT</c></NS>, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE).</p>
          <p><NS type="L"><i>ANYHOW</i><c>ANYWAY</c></NS> EVERYBODY <NS type="S"><i>SHOUD</i><c>SHOULD</c></NS> DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE. EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY).</p>
          <p>BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY <NS type="UY"><i>HOW</i></NS> TO DO IT. IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON <NS type="UD"><i>A</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>LIFE-STYLE</i><c>LIFESTYLE</c></NS>, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS.</p>
