I will be in <NS type="RP"><i>italy</i><c>Italy</c></NS> in August<NS type="UP"><i>.

          <p>I would <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> appreciate it if I could stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Camp<NS type="UP"><i>.

          <p><NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING</p>
          <p>Why do people like shopping? <NS type="MD"><i>First</i><c>The first</c></NS> answer is that they need <NS type="MV"><c>to go</c></NS> shopping. <NS type="MD"><i>Second</i><c>The second</c></NS> answer is that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel <NS type="MC"><c>like</c></NS> going shopping. When I <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>go</c></NS> shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but <NS type="MY"><c>only</c></NS> if it is possible to do <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.</p>
          <p>I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> most people were just looking and <NS type="UV"><i>were</i></NS> wasting <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> their time.</p>
          <p>If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.</p>
          <p>Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> situation you are in because when I was a child I always had <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>argument</i><c>arguments</c></NS> with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very <NS type="DJ"><i>ashameful</i><c>shameful</c></NS> for my mum. She was also very angry<NS type="UP"><i>. Because</i><c> because</c></NS> she never managed to get me out <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the toy shop.</p>
          <p>As you see<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> shopping is not always enjoyable. Always make sure that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> right time to go shopping.</p>
