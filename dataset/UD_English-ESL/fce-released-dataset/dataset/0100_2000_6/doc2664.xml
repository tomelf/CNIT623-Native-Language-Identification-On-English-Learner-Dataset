          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>Thank you for your letter. I was glad to hear from you.</p>
          <p>Like I said, <NS type="TV"><i>I'd helped</i><c>I helped</c></NS> at a pop concert. I liked it very much. It was very interesting and <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>enjoing</i><c>enjoying</c></NS></i><c>enjoyable</c></NS>.</p>
          <p><NS type="RD"><i>A</i><c>The</c></NS> pop concert had ten pop bands. Each of them <NS type="TV"><i>must <NS type="FV"><i>sang</i><c>sing</c></NS></i><c>had to sing</c></NS> two songs. After <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>that</c></NS> they chose <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> three best bands.</p>
          <p><NS type="R"><i>While</i><c>At</c></NS> this concert I saw a lot of popular singers. For example: Maraya Kary, Tom Jone; Madonna. I saw the "Boys on". I knew you love them and I <NS type="RV"><i>took</i><c>got</c></NS> two autographs for you and of course for myself.</p>
          <p>Afterwards "Boys on" won the first prize.</p>
          <p>I was <NS type="S"><i>shoked</i><c>shocked</c></NS> because I had <NS type="S"><i>alredy</i><c>already</c></NS> spoken with them and I had <NS type="RV"><i>taken</i><c>got</c></NS> two autographs.</p>
          <p><NS type="R">Another part of my <NS type="S"><i>experiance</i><c>experience</c></NS> at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pop concert when we <NS type="TV"><i>will meet</i><c>meet</c></NS> each other</NS>.</p>
          <p>Look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
