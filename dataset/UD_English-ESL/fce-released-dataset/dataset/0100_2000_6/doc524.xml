          <p>Dear <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> competition organiser (Helen Ryan)</p>

Firstly, I can only go in July<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I'm <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> holiday <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> that <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>time</c></NS>. I think I would prefer <NS type="R">the accommodation at Camp California is in tents</NS><NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> it is more <NS type="DJ"><i>safety</i><c>safe</c></NS>, and I <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>wouldn't</c></NS> like to be in the log cabins.</p>
          <p>The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>chose</i><c>choice</c></NS></i><c>choices</c></NS> which <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> I like. But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well. Photography is a very interesting <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS>, and is not too hard to do <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>either</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Here <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> have some questions which I would like to ask<NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>. What</c></NS> kind of clothes <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>sould</i><c>should</c></NS></i><c>will</c></NS> I need? How much <NS type="TV"><i>did</i><c>do</c></NS> I need for the Camp?</p>

          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable</p>
          <p> <NS type="AS"><i>Shopping, for most the people it is very important</i><c>Shopping is very important for most people</c></NS> because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a <NS type="RN"><i>method</i><c>way</c></NS> to relax <NS type="UA"><i>themselves</i></NS>, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still <NS type="R">have something you will not enjoy it</NS>. It depends on <NS type="R">what is the place and the aim you are shopping</NS>. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> some people always <NS type="TV"><i>shopping</i><c>shop</c></NS> to get food or stuff <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>they</c></NS> need in everyday life<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>. They</c></NS> won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> also very important. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in HK <NS type="R">all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping</NS><NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>have</i><c>there are</c></NS> too many people it <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> you want to stay home <NS type="M"><c>and you</c></NS> won't enjoy shopping.</p>
          <p><NS type="RY"><i>After</i><c>Now</c></NS> I've written this composition, I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time, but still <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>find</c></NS> sometimes you won't.</p>
