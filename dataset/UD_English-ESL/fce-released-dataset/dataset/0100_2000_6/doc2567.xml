          <p>Seoul is the capital city of Korea.</p>
          <p>It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million. I went to school there for twelve years. Many people <NS type="TV"><i>are saying</i><c>say</c></NS>: "When you have a son, send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> the best opportunity. There are all kinds of facilities <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>which</c></NS> you can imagine.</p>
          <p>Most of the people<NS type="U"><i>, they</i></NS> like to go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> centre of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> City<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that's Meong-Dong where <NS type="W"><i>is the <NS type="S"><i>uderground</i><c>underground</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>acade</i><c>arcade</c></NS></i><c>the underground arcade is</c></NS> and several businesses have their <NS type="IN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>head quarter</i><c>headquarter</c></NS></i><c>headquarters</c></NS> there. There are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where I can taste my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> foods.</p>
          <p>That doesn't cost much.</p>
          <p>If I go to visit my family in Korea, I usually walk along the Meong-Dong streets, and <NS type="TV"><i>am enjoying</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>to have eye-shopping</i><c>window shopping</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>But there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>alwalys</i><c>always</c></NS> a lot of traffic at all times, and the air is so polluted that I can't even breathe. I always feel very tired after the shopping because of <NS type="S"><i>unfrendly</i><c>unfriendly</c></NS> people who are too busy.</p>
          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
