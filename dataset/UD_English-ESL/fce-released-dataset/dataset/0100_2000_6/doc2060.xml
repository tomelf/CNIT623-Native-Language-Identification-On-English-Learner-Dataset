          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your last letter. As you asked me in your letter, I will try to explain my wonderful experience at <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> pop concert.</p>
          <p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you have to know that it wasn't <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS> pop concert, but a real <NS type="MP"><i>open air</i><c>open-air</c></NS> festival. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>This</c></NS> isn't the first year that I <NS type="TV"><i>work</i><c>have worked</c></NS> there. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> this year wasn't like last year.</p>
          <p>My job was <NS type="R"><i>as simple as</i><c>simply</c></NS> selling ice-creams. You might say that it <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> quite boring, but it was <NS type="RQ"><i>so</i><c>such</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS>. Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream.</p>
          <p>It was <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best.</p>
          <p>Love from</p>
