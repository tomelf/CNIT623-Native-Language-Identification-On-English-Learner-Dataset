          <p>Dear Sir or Madam</p>
          <p>Thank you for the letter. It was great to hear from you. I was surprised that I have won.</p>
          <p>By the way, I would like to travel in July, because <NS type="W"><i>just I</i><c>I just</c></NS> have free time in July. Moreover, I am keen on <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> summer.</p>
          <p>As can be seen from your letter, I can choose Accommodation. I would prefer to stay in tents. One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>wild life</i><c>wildlife</c></NS></i><c>nature</c></NS> more than <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> I stay in log cabins.</p>
          <p>According to your letter, there are 10 main activities which I can choose 2 and play while I am on the holiday. I would like to play Basketball and Golf. <NS type="R">Both of them I am not as good as you expect,</NS> but recently I have been <NS type="S"><i>intrested</i><c>interested</c></NS> in <NS type="RA"><i>those</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to ask some <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS> such as <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> clothes and money. What kind of clothes are <NS type="R">much to the camp</NS>? Furthermore<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> this is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> first time I have been <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> abroad<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> therefore I don't know how much money I should bring.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you</p>
          <p>yours sincerely</p>
