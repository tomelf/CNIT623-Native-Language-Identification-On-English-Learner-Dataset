          <p>Dear Ryan,</p>
          <p>I have received your letter and I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> so happy because I have won the holiday in California. It will be a pleasure for me <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> you the information that you need.</p>
          <p>First of all I would like to travel in July because I am going to Ibiza with my parents in June and in August I start to work part-time, so I am afraid <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>that</c></NS> I can go only in July.</p>
          <p>With reference to the accommodation<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would prefer <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>. I think <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> log cabins are more comfortable and I have never slept in a <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I <NS type="TV"><i>am playing</i><c>play</c></NS> at least <NS type="R"><i>at the</i><c>every</c></NS> weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> animals.</p>
          <p>I would like to know<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> how much <NS type="MN"><c>money</c></NS> I need and what type of clothes I should take? Could you tell me about the weather, please?</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely</p>

          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>I hope you are very well. I am writing about my exciting experience at a pop concert.</p>
          <p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I was too busy but it <NS type="TV"><i>does</i><c>did</c></NS> not matter because I enjoyed <NS type="W"><i>a lot <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> this experience</i><c>this experience a lot</c></NS>. I was doing different activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> from <NS type="DV"><i>designering</i><c>designing</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>flier</i><c>fliers</c></NS> to selling tickets.</p>
          <p>I had to search <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> pictures that could be used for the flier. We booked the accommodation for the group. I was responsible for checking the light and sound. In addition I checked the e-mail <NS type="S"><i>dialy</i><c>daily</c></NS> and answered the phone. As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too.</p>
          <p>Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful <NS type="AGN"><i>experience</i><c>experiences</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life, but the <NS type="W"><i>concert day</i><c>day of the concert</c></NS> was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event.</p>
          <p>If you have the opportunity of <NS type="RV"><i>involving</i><c>getting involved</c></NS> in something like this <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> do not hesitate.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely</p>
