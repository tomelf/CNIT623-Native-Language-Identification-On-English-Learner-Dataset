          <p>Dear Ms. Ryan,</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition. It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it.</p>

In</c></NS> August my family <NS type="TV"><i>going</i><c>are going</c></NS> to visit our relatives in Austria.</p>
          <p>I am not so keen about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomotation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> but would rather stay in tents than cabins. It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> company of your friends.</p>
          <p>It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I <NS type="TV"><i>am really enjoying</i><c>really enjoy</c></NS> swimming.

I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> just good.</p>
          <p>Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be <NS type="FJ"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> to take with me, what <NS type="W"><i>I'll</i><c>will I</c></NS> need at Camp?

          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>My best friend is crazy about shopping. She <NS type="TV"><i>will prefer</i><c>prefers</c></NS> shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant <NS type="MN"><c>way</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>spending of</i><c>of spending</c></NS> time, when you <NS type="TV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. <NS type="S"><i>Somitimes</i><c>Sometimes</c></NS> I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a <NS type="ID"><i>sense of living</i><c>reason for living</c></NS>. And <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="RA"><i>it's</i><c>there's</c></NS></i><c>there're</c></NS> so many people like her. Lots of families <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>planing</i><c>planning</c></NS></i><c>plan</c></NS> a day out to go to a shopping <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS>, and it is a normal routine for them - to <NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> all day just shopping. Not so many people <NS type="TV"><i>thinking</i><c>think</c></NS> about going fishing or playing <NS type="UN"><i>sport</i></NS> games with their families any more. They <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>have forgotten</c></NS> how beautiful <NS type="W"><i><NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> be the countryside</i><c>the countryside can be</c></NS>, and <NS type="W"><i>only tourists you can meet</i><c>you can only meet tourists</c></NS> in the castles or museums.</p>
          <p>People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get <NS type="RJ"><i>tied</i><c>tired</c></NS>. People <NS type="TV"><i>are not smiling</i><c>do not smile</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> each other, <NS type="TV"><i>not talking</i><c>do not talk</c></NS> to each other at the shops. They look like <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>robotes</i><c>robots</c></NS> who have to do their <NS type="FN"><i>duties</i><c>duty</c></NS> - to buy.</p>
          <p>In my opinion shopping is just <NS type="MA"><c>something</c></NS> to cover our basic needs. Shops are <NS type="R">not for spending our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS> in them</NS>. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> going to <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>do</c></NS> something together. It feels much <NS type="UY"><i>more</i></NS> better. You'll have happy memories and <NS type="M"><c>be in</c></NS> a good mood.</p>
