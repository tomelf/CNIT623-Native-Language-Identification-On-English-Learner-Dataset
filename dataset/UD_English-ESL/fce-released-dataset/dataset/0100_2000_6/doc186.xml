          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> few of us <NS type="UA"><i>who</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> very happy to spend money.</p>
          <p>Money is a very important thing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> shopping<NS type="RP"><i>, if</i><c>. If</c></NS> you have money, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's <NS type="S"><i>imagen</i><c>imagine</c></NS> that your credit card is not working, or some one <NS type="IV"><i>stold</i><c>stole</c></NS> your cash from your pocket. We will say <NS type="M"><c>you're</c></NS> unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are <NS type="DJ"><i>handicapt</i><c>handicapped</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Staying in a <NS type="S"><i>que</i><c>queue</c></NS> or <NS type="S"><i>croude</i><c>crowd</c></NS> is also <NS type="S"><i>unplesent</i><c>unpleasant</c></NS>. All <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need.</p>
          <p><NS type="S"><i>After words</i><c>Afterwards</c></NS> you are <NS type="S"><i>tiered</i><c>tired</c></NS> and have no <NS type="RN"><i>power</i><c>energy</c></NS> to do things.</p>
          <p>After all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> things that I have mentioned it is <NS type="DJ"><i>clearly</i><c>clear</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>seen</i></NS> that shopping is not enjoyable.</p>
