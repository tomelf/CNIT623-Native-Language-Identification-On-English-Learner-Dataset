          <p>Nowadays shopping is considered one of the most usual and enjoyable activities, especially if you are a woman and you are out to buy clothes. At first sight it is, but shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>Basing my opinion on my experience<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping. There are some points that <NS type="CE">give me the reason</NS>.</p>
          <p>First of all, who is your companion? If you take <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> mum shopping the <NS type="RJ">right</NS> day<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> she has been <NS type="W"><i>all day doing housework</i><c>doing housework all day</c></NS>, that will probably end in <NS type="RN"><i>discussion</i><c>argument</c></NS>.</p>
          <p><NS type="ID"><i>In one hand</i><c>On the one hand</c></NS>, there's you. You are feeling sick, <NS type="MC"><c>or</c></NS> angry with your boyfriend. How <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>can</c></NS> you <NS type="RV">pretend</NS> to see in a mirror that anything fits <NS type="W"><i>well <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> you</i><c>you well</c></NS>?</p>
          <p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, <NS type="X"><i>no</i><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>having</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> size for you or too high prices.</p>
          <p>Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping <NS type="RN"><i>journeys</i><c>trips</c></NS>? I'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it.</p>
