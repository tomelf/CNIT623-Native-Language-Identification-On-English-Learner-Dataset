          <p>Dear Madam,</p>
          <p>I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition and want to thank you for that very interesting competition.</p>
          <p>I am only available in July because I am studying <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July!</p>
          <p>You asked me which <NS type="M"><c>type of</c></NS> accommodation I would prefer between <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log cabin. I am used to <NS type="FV"><i>spend</i><c>spending</c></NS> summer <NS type="FN"><i>holiday</i><c>holidays</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent and I like it, but why not try <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> tennis and surfing. In fact, I <NS type="RY">soon</NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>play</c></NS> tennis and I am <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> good at <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>, and it will <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to train <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i> surfing</i><c>.  Surfing</c></NS> is completely <NS type="RJ"><i>unknown</i><c>new</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not!</p>
          <p>Finally, I <NS type="TV"><i>wanted</i><c>want</c></NS> to know if I need <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> money and how <NS type="CQ"><i>many</i><c>much</c></NS>, and if there is a <NS type="RN"><i>dry cleaning</i><c>dry cleaners</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully</p>

          <p>We <NS type="W"><i>know all</i><c>all know</c></NS> what shopping is. Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>When you <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>go</c></NS> to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but <NS type="X"><i>there is no more of it</i><c>it's not there anymore</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>. You</i><c>, you</c></NS> think that shopping is not enjoyable at all.</p>
          <p>Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> too <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> people. You don't like shopping but you must go shopping to eat!</p>
          <p>But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have <NS type="R">all your time</NS> (<NS type="R">the girls know what it is</NS>). <NS type="RP"><i>finally</i><c>Finally</c></NS>, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> time it isn't enjoyable!</p>
          <p>To conclude, if you don't want to go to the supermarket to spend four hours there, send your girlfriend and it will be more enjoyable!</p>
