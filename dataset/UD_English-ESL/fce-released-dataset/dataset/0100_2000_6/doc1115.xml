          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>I received your letter. I do not want to keep you curious any longer. The <NS type="S"><i>oppurnity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance. I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert. I, <NS type="RP"><i>ofcourse</i><c>of course</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> jumped <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>at</c></NS> it. The idea of meeting a <NS type="W"><i>worldwide known pop singer</i><c>pop singer known worldwide</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> just made my heart punch my ribcage. The concert <NS type="MN"></NS> was <NS type="DY"><i>all ready</i><c>already</c></NS> filled up with thousands <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS>, although it was really early. We, the volunteers<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> first unravelled the cables, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> set <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> the microphones and some instruments. Then we<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> were told go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>back stage</i><c>backstage</c></NS> and make sure everything was perfect. After a fantastic concert<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears. She is a very nice person<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I managed to <NS type="S"><i>scavange</i><c>scavenge</c></NS> an <NS type="S"><i>authograph</i><c>autograph</c></NS> for you as well<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I will put it in the envelope.</p>
          <p>Waiting to hear from you<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS></p>
          <p>Take <NS type="DN"><i>here</i><c>care</c></NS>!</p>
