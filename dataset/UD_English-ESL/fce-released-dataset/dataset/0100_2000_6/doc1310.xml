          <p>To. Director of <NS type="FN"><i>teacher</i><c>teachers</c></NS></p>

          <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
          <p>The aim of this report is <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>suggesting</i><c>to suggest</c></NS> which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> are suitable to make a film <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>EXPLAIN</p>
          <p>According to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> reactions of students. Most of the students are taking a morning class for 3 hours, and <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> middle of the lesson they're having a break time. After morning class they have a lunch time for 1 hour and continue to study for afternoon class. It's the most common daily life at our school. And according to the interviews, the most interesting class is the "upper <NS type="S"><i>intermidiate</i><c>intermediate</c></NS>" class. <NS type="R">They are joined with different countries and with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good teacher.</NS></p>
          <p>SUGGESTION</p>
          <p>The point of "upper <NS type="S"><i>intermidiate</i><c>intermediate</c></NS> class". They are having <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> special time. Every Friday, they enjoy a special game <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>check</i><c>to check</c></NS> vocabulary.

          <p>CONCLUSION</p>
          <p>I strongly recommend <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> making a video about "Upper intermidiate" class. <NS type="CE">They must be shown the most well-class in our school.</NS></p>
