          <p>Dear Helen Ryan</p>
          <p>I've just received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in your competition <NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> 2 weeks at Camp California in the USA. I am very glad to hear that and would like to tell you all the <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> you need to know from me.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be <NS type="UJ"><i>long</i></NS> enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> other holidays because for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Easter holiday I need to <NS type="RV"><i>attend</i><c>take part in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Tennis competition <NS type="R">in the name of</NS> my school and we need time to practise. In <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="RN">ferry trip</NS> with my relatives. <NS type="AGD"><i>That</i><c>Those</c></NS> are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other <NS type="AGN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS>. I do <NS type="S"><i>appologize</i><c>apologize</c></NS> about that.</p>
          <p>I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I <NS type="TV"><i>say</i><c>said</c></NS> before<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> I have to <NS type="RV"><i>attend</i><c>take part in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tennis competition<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9<NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county <NS type="RN">player</NS> <NS type="MC"><c>when</c></NS> I was 12. I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>attended</i><c>took part in</c></NS></i><c>have taken part in</c></NS> 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad <NS type="RV"><i>influences</i><c>encourages</c></NS> me to play tennis and <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> enjoy it. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> climbing, I started to be interested in it <NS type="RC"><i>since</i><c>when</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>I</c></NS> was 14. My family live near the sea so we <NS type="TV"><i>have got</i><c>get</c></NS> quite a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>chance</i><c>chances</c></NS> to go climbing. I'm not scared of <NS type="FN"><i>height</i><c>heights</c></NS> and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.</p>
          <p>I would like to ask you a few questions. How hot is it in California in July? <NS type="R"><NS type="RP"><i>so</i><c>So</c></NS></NS> I know what kind of clothes I need. Do I need a lot of money<NS type="RP"><i>, will</i><c>? Will</c></NS> we have time for shopping<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> What kind of food do we eat? This is because I cannot eat Pork. If <NS type="AGA"><i>there</i><c>this</c></NS> is <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="IN"><i>unconvenience</i><c>inconvenience</c></NS>, please feel free to tell me. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely</p>

          <p>Dear Kim</p>
          <p>How are you? I am sorry that I didn't write any <NS type="AGN"><i>letter</i><c>letters</c></NS> to <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> during <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> last month. I really wish you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>had been</c></NS> with me last month. <NS type="S"><i>Quess</i><c>Guess</c></NS> what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that <NS type="RV"><i>happened</i><c>was put on</c></NS> at my school. That's why I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>have had</c></NS> no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it!</p>
          <p>As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>liked</c></NS> it and <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> quite good marks for my project<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether <NS type="AGA"><i>I</i><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS></i><c>would</c></NS> be able and willing to help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the concert in two <NS type="MP"><i>weeks</i><c>weeks'</c></NS> time in the concert hall. I immediately <NS type="TV"><i>say</i><c>said</c></NS> "yes" and <NS type="R"><i>also</i><c>so did</c></NS> my friend. I really <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>thought</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>sounds</i><c>sounded</c></NS> so interesting. I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> never done light and sound for <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> real pop concert before and I <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>thought</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be a good experience for me. Actually <NS type="TV"><i>I've</i><c>I'd</c></NS> just done light and sound <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>drama's</i><c>drama</c></NS> day <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> my school at the end of last term. But this time <NS type="TV"><i>it'll</i><c>it'd</c></NS> be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
          <p>The <NS type="S"><i>preperation</i><c>preparation</c></NS> days came. <NS type="MT"><i>The</i><c>On the</c></NS> first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their <NS type="FN"><i>jobs</i><c>job</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS></i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>preparing</i><c>to prepare</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>for the</c></NS> concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was <NS type="S"><i>amuzing</i><c>amazing</c></NS>! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> stage, <NS type="FN"><i>light</i><c>lights</c></NS>, sound<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> background. I felt like <NS type="TV"><i>I'm</i><c>I was</c></NS> one of those <NS type="AGN"><i>professional</i><c>professionals</c></NS> too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>are</c></NS>? It was good fun though! <NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>but</i><c>But</c></NS> my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to <NS type="FV"><i>enjoyed</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> it as much as I <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>did</c></NS>.</p>
          <p><NS type="ID">At the end of the day</NS>, my ambition is to be like one of <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>those</c></NS> professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> me <NS type="TV"><i>to try</i><c>try</c></NS> to work very hard and this term I <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much<NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> I have my aim <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder.</p>
          <p>I hope you will feel like me one day. I will write to you again soon and tell you how I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> getting on.</p>
          <p>Lots of love</p>
