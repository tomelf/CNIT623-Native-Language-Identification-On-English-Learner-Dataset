          <p><NS type="S"><i>Shoping</i><c>Shopping</c></NS> is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>As a housewife I have a good <NS type="R">idea about it</NS>. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go <NS type="R"><i>two days</i><c>twice</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not.</p>
          <p>I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not the same. <NS type="MD"><i>Shops</i><c>The shops</c></NS> are so crowded and it takes <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>have</c></NS> to face a long queue in order to pay. <NS type="AS"><i>Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people</i><c>It is tiring for some people to spend long hours shopping</c></NS>. I find it very tiring sometimes.</p>
          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually <NS type="W"><i>much more money we spend</i><c>we spend much more money</c></NS> than we expect. We can't do anything about <NS type="R"><i>is</i><c>it</c></NS>. We have to face it - it <NS type="R">has both sides</NS>. Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>.</p>
