          <p>Dear Helen Ryan,</p>
          <p>I am amazed <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the prize in your competition. I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information.</p>
          <p>I would like to travel only in July because this is the only month that I am on holiday each year.</p>
          <p>About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because it will be a new experience for me. I like to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>have</c></NS> new experiences<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> when I am on holiday.</p>
          <p>I am <NS type="RJ"><i>pleasant</i><c>pleased</c></NS> to have the opportunity to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> sports as well. I am good at swimming and playing tennis.</p>
          <p>I would like to know how much money I need to have to spend there and if I need to take with me my sports clothes. Will <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and <NS type="FV"><i>play</i><c>playing</c></NS> tennis?</p>
          <p>If you need some more information let me know.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely</p>
          <p>Rita Fernandez.</p>

          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable</p>
          <p>In my opinion shopping is a very good <NS type="RN">practice</NS> <NS type="UV"><i>that's</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>give</i><c>gives</c></NS> you more <NS type="AGN"><i>opportunity</i><c>opportunities</c></NS> to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> at least they say that <NS type="M"><c>they don't</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>I</c></NS> love shopping I have to agree that it is not "always" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's <NS type="RJ"><i>boring</i><c>annoying</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>You shouldn't go shopping when the <NS type="S"><i>shopps</i><c>shops</c></NS> are so busy because <NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS> so <NS type="RJ"><i>boring</i><c>annoying</c></NS>. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas.</p>
          <p>Another point is <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> now you don't need to go out <NS type="U"><i>just for</i></NS> shopping. You can buy a lot of products <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet.</p>
          <p>I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it.</p>
          <p>In conclusion I think there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> boring <NS type="AGN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS> and enjoyable <NS type="AGN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS> when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring <NS type="AGN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS>.</p>
