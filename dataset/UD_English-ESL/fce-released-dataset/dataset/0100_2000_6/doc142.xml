          <p>DEAR KIM,</p>
          <p>YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP AT A CONCERT. TO BE <NS type="R"><i>IN A</i><c>PART OF THE</c></NS> STAFF <NS type="UN"><i>TEAM</i></NS> WOULD BE WONDERFUL, I <NS type="S"><i>THOUGTH</i><c>THOUGHT</c></NS>. AND I WAS RIGHT! BUT NOW FROM THE BEGINNING:</p>
          <p>AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION <NS type="RA"><i>WHO</i><c>WHICH</c></NS> IS ALWAYS <NS type="S"><i>RESPONSBLE</i><c>RESPONSIBLE</c></NS> FOR BIG EVENTS. ONE WEEK LATER THEY INVITED ME TO A POP CONCERT WHICH TOOK PLACE IN ZURICH LAST MONTH.</p>
          <p>WHEN I ARRIVED WE FIRST HAD A MEETING. ALL <NS type="RT"><i>FROM</i><c>OF</c></NS> THE STAFF <NS type="UN"><i>TEAM</i></NS> AND THE ORGANISATION <NS type="S"><i>SPOK</i><c>SPOKE</c></NS> ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE. AFTER THE MEETING <NS type="W"><i>WE <NS type="S"><i>RECIEVED</i><c>RECEIVED</c></NS> ALL</i><c>WE ALL RECEIVED</c></NS> THE SAME CLOTHES. WE WERE A <NS type="S"><i>GROUPE</i><c>GROUP</c></NS>! ONE TEAM! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE <NS type="RJ"><i>OTHER</i><c>DIFFERENT</c></NS> HOBBIES AND <NS type="RN"><i>WORK</i><c>JOBS</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>THE CONCERT WAS <NS type="S"><i>VERRY</i><c>VERY</c></NS> LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD. I WAS HAPPY THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER FOR THE PEOPLE DURING THE CONCERT. AFTER A NICE CONCERT WE HAD TO CLEAN EVERYTHING AND I WAS HAPPY WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME EARLY IN THE MORNING..!</p>
          <p><NS type="L"><NS type="S"><i>GREATING</i><c>GREETINGS</c></NS></NS> AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON</p>
