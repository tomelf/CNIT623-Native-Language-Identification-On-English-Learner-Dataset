          <p>Dear Sir/madam,</p>
          <p>Thank you for your letter and your congratulations. I never thought that I would win the competition. It is really wonderful. I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks.</p>
          <p>I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to come at</c></NS> that time. And <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>concerning</c></NS> my accommodation<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS></i><c>to stay</c></NS> in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere <NS type="R"><i>when</i><c>in which</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>live</i><c>will be living</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS>.</p>
          <p>I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming. Before I came <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> England, I swam every weekend in my country<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp.</p>
          <p>Actually, my mind has already gone there<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I can't wait even for a minute. I want to go there now.</p>
          <p>By the way, I would like to know <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the shopping<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially for clothes<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I want to buy some for myself. And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there?</p>
          <p>I look forward to your letter.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
