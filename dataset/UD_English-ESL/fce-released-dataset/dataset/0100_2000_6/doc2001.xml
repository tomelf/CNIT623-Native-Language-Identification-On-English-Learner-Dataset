          <p>Dear Kim:</p>
          <p>I am writing to you to tell you what an <NS type="DJ"><i>impressing</i><c>impressive</c></NS> experience I have had<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> helping at a pop concert.</p>
          <p>I will start <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> telling you how crowded it was, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> so excited that they were screaming from the beginning to the end. I couldn't even hear my own voice.</p>
          <p>I cleared the stage before the concert, but you <NS type="RV"><i>don't</i><c>can't</c></NS> imagine <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> it looked like after it?!!! full of flowers, <NS type="RP"><i>T. shirts</i><c>T-shirts</c></NS>, hats, underwear, etc etc etc. I <NS type="RV"><i>didn't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> feel my feet the next day, I was very tired.!! Anyway, I also laughed a lot, the music was fantastic, and the stars were really nice to <NS type="RP"><i>every one</i><c>everyone</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>I tried to take a photo of everyone, but sometimes it was not possible. I will send you a copy of the best pictures the next time.</p>
          <p>bye-bye.</p>
