What's</c></NS> more, more and more people <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>are starting</c></NS> to learn English. <NS type="R">The activity of making brain up</NS> can help us remember new words.

          <p>Conclusion:</p>
          <p>It is recommended that <NS type="MA"><c>something</c></NS> should be filmed about Maths, English study skills,<NS type="R">make brain up</NS> and <NS type="U"><i>a part of</i></NS> playing football.</p>
