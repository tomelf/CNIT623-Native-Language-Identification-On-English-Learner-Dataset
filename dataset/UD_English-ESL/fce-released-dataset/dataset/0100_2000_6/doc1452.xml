          <p>Dear Kim.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your lovely letter and I hope you are well.</p>
          <p>The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really <NS type="MY"><c>more</c></NS> interesting than I expected. My job <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> behind the stage was helping <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> make-up, <NS type="RN"><i>hare</i><c>hair</c></NS> and clothes <NS type="DN">staylist</NS>. It was very hard. The singers often changed <NS type="DD"><i>them</i><c>their</c></NS> clothes and <NS type="DD"><i>them</i><c>their</c></NS> make-up was <NS type="R">easy to be off</NS> because of the sweat. It was different from <NS type="MY"><c>when</c></NS> I did <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous <NS type="AGN"><i>singer</i><c>singers</c></NS> and spoke to them. <NS type="W"><i>In front of the stage <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> so many people</i><c>So many people were in front of the stage</c></NS> and they couldn't see them very well, but I was <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> very near <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> the stage and I could see them just there.</p>
          <p>You like pop music, don't you? So, don't go to a concert! Work at a concert! That's much more exciting.</p>
          <p>Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't <NS type="RV"><i>met</i><c>seen</c></NS> each other <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> so long time and I'll tell you more <NS type="AGN"><i>story</i><c>stories</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> this.</p>
          <p>Write soon,</p>
          <p>Bye Bye.</p>
