          <p>Dear Kim,</p>
          <p>I don't know where to start but I can say it was the <NS type="RJ"><i>greatest</i><c>best</c></NS> time I have ever had.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you before<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Friend</i><c>friend</c></NS> of mine<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>she</i></NS> is a stage assistant and she needed <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> that pop concert last month.</p>
          <p>I told her if she <NS type="TV"><i>need</i><c>needed</c></NS> help<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would be happy to help her. Next day<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when I went there<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have met</i><c>met</c></NS> lots of people <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> very famous and very friendly. It took us almost a month to prepare for this concert.</p>
          <p>You wouldn't believe how hard it was. <NS type="RP"><i>the</i><c>The</c></NS> stage was covered with all <NS type="FN"><i>sort</i><c>sorts</c></NS> of light and we made it look like a waterfall.</p>
          <p>The waterfall <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>was made</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> real rock so that was the worst bit because <NS type="AG"><i>they were</i><c>it was</c></NS> really heavy and we had to carry <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS>, but <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the end of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>moth</i><c>month</c></NS> when the concert started, it was all over.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="TV"><i>sung</i><c>sang</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i>dance</i><c>danced</c></NS> all day. I have lots of <NS type="AGN"><i>memory</i><c>memories</c></NS> which I could never forget.</p>
          <p>I wish you were there.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="RV"><i>hope</i><c>wish</c></NS> you shared my happiness with me.</p>
          <p>Lots of love,</p>
