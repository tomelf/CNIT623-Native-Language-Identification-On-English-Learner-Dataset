          <p>Dear Mrs Helen,</p>
          <p>I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you <NS type="TV"><i>giving</i><c>are giving</c></NS> me.</p>
          <p><NS type="SX"><i>Fist</i><c>First</c></NS> of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="IJ"><i>hotest</i><c>hottest</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS> in the year, and the weather <NS type="RV"><i>shall</i><c>will</c></NS> be really nice.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think it <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> would be better to stay <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> tents, so <NS type="RC"><i>than</i><c>that</c></NS> we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS>.</p>
          <p>However, as you asked me to choose two activities, I'm choosing swimming and climbing, because I'm very good at swimming and I would like to try <NS type="U"><i>myself at</i></NS> climbing. Despite <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>small</i><c>lack of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>expereance</i><c>experience</c></NS> in climbing I do want to try this type of sport.</p>
          <p>In addition, I would like to know how much money <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> I have to bring with me.</p>
          <p>I think that <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is all <NS type="R"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> I would like to know.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>hear</i><c>hearing</c></NS> from you.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
