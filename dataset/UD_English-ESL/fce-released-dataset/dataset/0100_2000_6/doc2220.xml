          <p>Dear Kin,</p>
          <p>As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the band called RAMONES.</p>
          <p>It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> those guys really know how to play rock.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="W"><i>had only</i><c>only had</c></NS> to stay behind the drummer <NS type="S"><i>suppling</i><c>supplying</c></NS> them with water whenever they wanted.</p>
          <p>When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the <NS type="SX"><i>faints</i><c>fence</c></NS> getting very close to them<NS type="RP"><i>, some</i><c>.  Some</c></NS> of the girls started to take their clothes <NS type="RY"><i>of</i><c>off</c></NS>, which was the best part for me, but some of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>securities</i><c>security</c></NS> went there and took them away.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>came</c></NS> back from their break <NS type="TV"><i>they've just went</i><c>they just went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>off</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>!</c></NS></p>
          <p>I had a really nice time with them even <NS type="S"><i>tought</i><c>though</c></NS> I would've <NS type="IV"><i>prefered</i><c>preferred</c></NS> to stay at the front with the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I <NS type="S"><i>holp</i><c>hope</c></NS> to be able to help them next year.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="S"><i>holp</i><c>hope</c></NS> you've <NS type="S"><i>enjoed</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
          <p>See yah mate</p>
