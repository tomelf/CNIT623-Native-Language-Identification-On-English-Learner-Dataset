          <p>Because my course finishes at the end of June and I am going to work for a <NS type="RP"><i>Hotel</i><c>hotel</c></NS> in August and September, I would like to travel in July. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>That</c></NS> is the best time for me.</p>
          <p>As far as accommodation is <NS type="DJ"><i>concern</i><c>concerned</c></NS>, I would like to say that I prefer to stay in tents. I like staying in tents because when we go on holiday with my friends, we always stay in tents, so I am used to staying in tents.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I have also been asked to choose some activities. I would like to choose basketball and swimming. When I was at school, I <NS type="TV"><i>have been playing</i><c>played</c></NS> for the school team and I am good at swimming.</p>
          <p>Finally, could you let me know what sort of clothes would be <NS type="FJ"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> to bring. It would also be useful to know <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> how much money <NS type="U"><i>will be enough</i></NS> to bring.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
