          <p>Dear Helen Ryan<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the <NS type="S"><i>midle</i><c>middle</c></NS> of June and I have to attend <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> a '<NS type="CL"><i>Development &amp; Research</i><c>Research and Development</c></NS> Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> assistant from the beginning of <NS type="S"><i>Aguest</i><c>August</c></NS>. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have <NS type="RY">ever</NS> slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent. <NS type="MD"><i>Whole</i><c>The whole</c></NS> night, I felt backache <NS type="S"><i>ands</i><c>and</c></NS> shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. <NS type="W"><i>Especially I</i><c>I especially</c></NS> love <NS type="DN"><i>water-painting</i><c>watercolours</c></NS>. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't <NS type="FV"><i>swimming</i><c>swim</c></NS> at all. I'm afraid of water. That <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> why I <NS type="TV"><i>couldn't have swimmed</i><c>can't swim</c></NS> yet. I think this <NS type="W"><i>chance is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very good</i><c>is a very good chance</c></NS> for me to learn to swim. I expect to join <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for <NS type="IV"><i>clubing</i><c>clubbing</c></NS> or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. <NS type="RV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'm going to</c></NS> buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible <NS type="DA"><i>Your</i><c>Yours</c></NS> sincerely</p>

          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> every <NS type="AGN"><i>shops</i><c>shop</c></NS>. I always want to buy T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, <NS type="FN"><i>cosmetic</i><c>cosmetics</c></NS>, <NS type="FN"><i>hairband</i><c>haribands</c></NS>, accessories, <NS type="FN"><i>ring</i><c>rings</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>earings</i><c>earrings</c></NS>, <NS type="FN"><i>bracelet</i><c>bracelets</c></NS>, shoes, hats, bags, fancy <NS type="CN"><i>stationeries</i><c>stationery</c></NS>, interior <NS type="FN"><i>stuffs</i><c>stuff</c></NS> and <NS type="FN"><i>CD</i><c>CDs</c></NS>. But it is impossible to buy everything at the same time. I have to <NS type="TV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> some of them and I have to give up buying most of them. Before I go out <NS type="UY"><i>home</i></NS>, I make a plan. <NS type="M"><i>What</i><c>I decide what</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items.</p>
          <p>But when I stand <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>outside</c></NS> every <NS type="AGN"><i>shops</i><c>shop</c></NS>, I can't <NS type="RV"><i>stand</i><c>resist</c></NS> my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> why I'm so poor. But I can get over <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. I go window shopping. <NS type="S"><i>Insead</i><c>Instead</c></NS> of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try <NS type="RQ"><i>every</i><c>all</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and <NS type="S"><i>jakect</i><c>jackets</c></NS> on. They are mine!</p>
          <p>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</p>
          <p>But if you think positive <NS type="UN"><i>opinion</i></NS> about shopping, <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> will make you the happiest and the <NS type="SX"><i>riches</i><c>richest</c></NS> man in the world.</p>
