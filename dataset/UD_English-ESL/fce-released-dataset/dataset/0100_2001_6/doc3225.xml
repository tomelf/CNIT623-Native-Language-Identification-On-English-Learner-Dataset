          <p>Report on the "Paintings Museum"</p>
          <p>In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the <NS type="S"><i>exibitions</i><c>exhibitions</c></NS> and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too.</p>
          <p>Location</p>
          <p>The museum is located in Ouchy, <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the "Delamuraz Hotel". It is close to the main road, and <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> 300 <NS type="SA"><i>meters</i><c>metres</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> the station.</p>
          <p>Outside</p>
          <p>The building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to <NS type="SX"><i>pas</i><c>pass</c></NS> through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your <NS type="RP"><i>swim suit</i><c>swimsuit</c></NS>, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pools.</p>
          <p>Inside</p>
          <p>When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. <NS type="AGA"><i>There</i><c>They</c></NS> were all <NS type="TV"><i>painting</i><c>painted</c></NS> during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the <NS type="S"><i>ceilar</i><c>cellar</c></NS>. Everything in this room is <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>connected with</c></NS> wine.</p>
          <p>To learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor.</p>
          <p>I particularly recommend you to visit the "blue" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door.</p>
          <p>According to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed.</p>
          <p>Conclusion</p>
          <p>To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself.</p>
          <p>You won't be disappointed.</p>
          <p>The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> the house and the garden.</p>
