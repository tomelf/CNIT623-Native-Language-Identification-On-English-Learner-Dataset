When you go to the conference, you can take a bus or a taxi. But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend <NS type="FV"><i>to walk</i><c>walking</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.

          <p>Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and <NS type="M"><c>our lives more</c></NS> convenient. Moreover we <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> live without them. For example: electricity, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer, <NS type="S"><i>telephon</i><c>telephone</c></NS>, boat, and car (wheel), etc. None of them are unimportant for us.</p>
          <p>But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them. If you look around at home, there are a lot of electric things. Electricity <NS type="R"><i>could be</i><c>made us</c></NS> able to invent other things. It also gave us more free time, especially for women. It has <NS type="DY"><i>abosolutly</i><c>absolutely</c></NS> reduced women's <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>house working</i><c>housework</c></NS> time.</p>
          <p><NS type="W"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Evenmore</i><c>Even more</c></NS> we can enjoy our night</i><c>We can enjoy our night even more</c></NS> with lights. If we want <NS type="FV"><i>do</i><c>to do</c></NS> something, we can do it at night <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> same as <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> day.</p>
          <p>Finally<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the quality of our life is changed by electricity. It could reduce our working time and make us <NS type="RJ">enjoyable</NS>. It is also advancing more and more. It will give us <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> better future!</p>
          <p>Have you ever imagined that you would drive <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> electric car!</p>
