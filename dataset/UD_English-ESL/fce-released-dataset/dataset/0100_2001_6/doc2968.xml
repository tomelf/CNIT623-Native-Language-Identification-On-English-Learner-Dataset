          <p>Dear Mr Wolf</p>
          <p>I am writing to answer your question about <NS type="U"><i>the information on</i></NS> an interesting building to visit. I would like to introduce one building in my town.</p>
          <p>"Sky Heaven"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is the name of the building, is <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> fifteen minutes from the centre of my town.

It <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> a good experience for your students.</p>
