          <p>Dear Mrs <NS type="UN"><i>Maria</i></NS> Smith,</p>
          <p>I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you.</p>
          <p>You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>:</c></NS> once you <NS type="TV"><i>have gone out</i><c>go out</c></NS> of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>beside</c></NS> our college. When you are in the college<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> ask for me.</p>
          <p>The conference will <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>last</c></NS> one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> is a formal party and you should wear formal <NS type="RN"><i>stuff</i><c>clothes</c></NS>. The dress code is<NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> no jeans. We will <NS type="RV"><i>prove</i><c>provide</c></NS> you with food and drinks.</p>
          <p>For your free <NS type="RN"><i>hours</i><c>time</c></NS> I have quite a few ideas. There are lots of things to do here.

          <p>THE MOBILE PHONE</p>
          <p>The mobile phone has completely changed our lives, it is an instrument which I cannot imagine myself living without.</p>
          <p>Apart from being <NS type="UP"><i>in-fashion</i><c>in fashion</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it?</p>
          <p>Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone. I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone. Five years ago you wouldn't have even thought about it. It has been a plus for me. For example, now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me, and, sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with.</p>
          <p><NS type="ID"><i>All over</i><c>All in all</c></NS>, the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone.</p>
