          <p>Dear Mrs Smith,</p>
          <p>I am writing to inform you that I have <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS> a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college.</p>
          <p>Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is not very far from my college. However, due to the <NS type="CN"><i>congestions</i><c>congestion</c></NS> and <NS type="RN"><NS type="FN"><i>delay</i><c>delays</c></NS></NS> near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> underground, <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> Victoria Street <NS type="RP"><i>station</i><c>Station</c></NS>. You <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes.</p>
          <p>At the end-of-conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities. <NS type="UQ"><i>All different</i><c>Different</c></NS> types of clothing <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> be worn<NS type="MP"><i> however</i><c>. However,</c></NS> <NS type="DN">jean wears</NS> and T-shirts <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be <NS type="RJ">common</NS> on that day.</p>
          <p>Instead <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS> perhaps visit our town centre. The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> market square, <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> be found near <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>the</c></NS> monument of our town, the Saltisy Bridge.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> you soon.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
