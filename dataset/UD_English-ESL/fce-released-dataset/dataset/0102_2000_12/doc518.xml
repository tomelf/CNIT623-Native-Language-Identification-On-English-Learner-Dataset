          <p>Dear Jane Clark,</p>
          <p>I am writing about the International Arts Festival which has just finished.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="TV"><i>congratulated</i><c>congratulate</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> you because it <NS type="TV"><i>has been</i><c>was</c></NS> a great idea <NS type="RC"><i>since</i><c>and</c></NS> the town needed a cultural event. I especially <NS type="TV"><i>appreciate</i><c>appreciated</c></NS> the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford, <NS type="RY"><i>also</i><c>even</c></NS> students like me.</p>
          <p>However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances. You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have <NS type="TV"><i>appreciate</i><c>appreciated</c></NS> seeing more of them. For next year's <NS type="RN"><i>edition</i><c>festival</c></NS>, you could possibly add some foreign films, like <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Chinese ones, which I <NS type="W"><i>most like</i><c>like most</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Finally, in order to make <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> a really international festival, I think you should invite artists from all over the world, not just from six countries like this year.</p>
          <p>I hope that you will appreciate my opinions and suggestions, which I have shared with my friends.</p>
          <p> Yours sincerely,</p>
