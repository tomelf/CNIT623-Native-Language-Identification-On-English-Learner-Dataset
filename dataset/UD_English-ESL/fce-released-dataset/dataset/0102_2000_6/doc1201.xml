          <p>Dear manager,</p>
          <p>I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>appeared</c></NS> with wrong information.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the actors were different from the ones <NS type="UV"><i>written</i></NS> in the advertisement<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was very disappointing for me. Furthermore, according to the advertisement <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>it</c></NS> was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15. Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price <NS type="RV"><i>written</i><c>published</c></NS> in the advertisement.</p>
          <p>When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I could not get in because it was closed as the <NS type="W"><i>chef of the restaurant</i><c>restaurant's chef</c></NS> was not there.</p>
          <p>I did not have a perfect evening out and I would like to have my money back.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
