          <p>Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite <NS type="RJ">deceiving</NS>. I am writing to you to <NS type="DV"><i>complaint</i><c>complain</c></NS> about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> picked up in the hall of the theatre, <NS type="W"><i>are there</i><c>there are</c></NS> about five points which were not <NS type="RJ"><i>respected</i><c>true</c></NS>. To begin with, as far as the <NS type="R"><i>starring</i><c>cast</c></NS> is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very <NS type="RJ"><i>deceived</i><c>disappointed</c></NS>, and this could be the understatement of the year, <NS type="UY"><i>inasmuch</i></NS> as he is my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor. Apart from <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS>, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me the reasons <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> such a huge <NS type="R"><i>late</i><c>delay</c></NS>? Thirdly, the ad <NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS> possible discounts. <NS type="DY"><i>Personnaly</i><c>Personally</c></NS> speaking, I didn't <NS type="FV"><i>saw</i><c>see</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> and <NS type="W"><i>even didn't</i><c>didn't even</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>heard</i><c>hear</c></NS> of <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>: I <NS type="TV"><i>have asked</i><c>asked</c></NS> about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for <NS type="FN"><i>renovations</i><c>renovation</c></NS>! How can you dare <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>putting</i><c>put</c></NS></i><c>publish</c></NS> an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> the fact that I did not <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> a "perfect evening out" at all, <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS></i><c>promised</c></NS> in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> me my money back. I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>hear</i><c>hearing</c></NS> from you. Yours faithfully,</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If only Paul had <NS type="TV"><i>knew</i><c>known</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> before...</p>
          <p><NS type="ID"><i>Everything had begun</i><c>It all began</c></NS> when Paul went downstairs <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel <NS type="RT"><i>across</i><c>along</c></NS> the dark paths of his <NS type="S"><i>councience</i><c>conscience</c></NS>. He went through <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves</p>
          <p>While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a <NS type="W"><i>grey huge</i><c>huge grey</c></NS> stone, on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> top of which he could stare <NS type="MY"><c>across</c></NS> the whole <NS type="AGN"><i>woods</i><c>wood</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was <NS type="RV"><i>wandering</i><c>wondering</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wether</i><c>whether</c></NS> this beast could be <NS type="RJ"><i>offensive</i><c>aggressive</c></NS> when the creature said these words<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "I am glad to meet you, Paul." The boy could not <NS type="S"><i>beleive</i><c>believe</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> what he was hearing. How did the beast <NS type="FV"><i>knew</i><c>know</c></NS> his name? "You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>get</c></NS> out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> your reality!"</p>
          <p>At these words, Paul <NS type="S"><i>suddently</i><c>suddenly</c></NS> awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately...one <NS type="SX"><i>our</i><c>hour</c></NS> after <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>, a local zoo <NS type="MN"><c>keeper</c></NS> arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="M"><c>she did</c></NS> not <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Faerian food necessary <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> her survival.</p>
          <p>This is how <NS type="RN"><i>human</i><c>mankind</c></NS> destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream. This is <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>why</c></NS> mankind can't be relied on. This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result <NS type="U"><i>of it</i></NS>.</p>
