          <p>Hello Sir,</p>
          <p>"<NS type="S"><i>Um</i><c>I'm</c></NS> very <NS type="RJ"><i>unpleased</i><c>unhappy</c></NS> that I have to write you this letter. I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much.</p>
          <p>On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical "Over the Rainbow" <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the "Circle <NS type="SA"><i>Theater</i><c>Theatre</c></NS>". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the <NS type="RN"><i>points</i><c>reasons</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>because</i><c>why</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>appear</c></NS>! So when the miserable musical came to <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>its</c></NS> end, we were happy to leave the <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>room</i><c>auditorium</c></NS>, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no <NS type="IN"><i>restaurantes</i><c>restaurants</c></NS> were <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just <NS type="MV"><c>found</c></NS> a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a <NS type="RJ"><i>short</i><c>small</c></NS> sign on a door: "Sorry, we are closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> renovations"! We thought it <NS type="UV"><i>would</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>was</c></NS> a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS>. I would prefer <NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>to get</c></NS> my money back, instead of <NS type="RV"><i>taking</i><c>getting</c></NS> a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!</p>
