          <p>Unfortunately Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. So one week later all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> in my class knew that I was an <NS type="RN"><i>angle</i><c>angel</c></NS>. <NS type="RY"><i>Certainly</i><c>Really</c></NS>! Nobody believed her... <NS type="RC"><i>neither</i><c>nor</c></NS> me.</p>
          <p>But it's true... I'm an <NS type="RN"><i>angle</i><c>angel</c></NS> and I wanted to visit the earth. It's easy to do but the only <NS type="UD"><i>one</i></NS> rule was I <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> tell my secret to only one person. And if someone <NS type="S"><i>elso</i><c>else</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>knows</i><c>knew</c></NS>, I <NS type="TV"><i>won't</i><c>wouldn't</c></NS> be able to go back to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> heaven unless I <NS type="TV"><i>kill</i><c>killed</c></NS> the person who told my secret.</p>
          <p>Pat was the only person who I told my secret <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> but now it has become a joke! I promised to myself... I would have to kill her!</p>
          <p>I <NS type="RV"><i>started</i><c>began to follow</c></NS> my plan. I went to Pat's house but her brother told me that she wasn't there. I offered to wait... Her brother and I began to talk... He's such a nice boy. I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too...</p>
          <p>We started to go out <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time as I started to change my mind. I don't want to go back to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> heaven anymore as long as I am with him.</p>
