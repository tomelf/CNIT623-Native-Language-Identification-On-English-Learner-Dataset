          <p>Dear manager of the Circle Theatre,</p>
          <p>Last night, I <NS type="S"><i>cam</i><c>came</c></NS> to your musical show, "Over the rainbow"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and I was very disappointed because it wasn't <NS type="MT"><c>like</c></NS> what you <NS type="IV"><i>writed</i><c>wrote</c></NS> in your advertisement. For example, your advertisement said that the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>stars</c></NS> were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not <NS type="R"><i>them</i><c>there</c></NS>! <NS type="RA"><i>They</i><c>There</c></NS> were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This <NS type="RN"><i>event</i><c>problem</c></NS> was not the only one because another problem was <NS type="ID"><i>the respect of</i><c>with respect to</c></NS> the time. Your advertisement said that the show <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> start at 19:30 PM, but it <NS type="TV"><i>has started</i><c>started</c></NS> at 20:15 PM. I don't like to <NS type="R">have such big change in time</NS>. The third problem was that it was <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS></i><c>written</c></NS> that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> discounts were available, but when I <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation. <NS type="R"><i>After that</i><c>Finally</c></NS>, I can tell you that I <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied <NS type="R"><i>about</i><c>to say</c></NS> "You will have a perfect evening!" After all these <NS type="RN"><i>explanations</i><c>complaints</c></NS>, I am sure that you will understand <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>why</c></NS> I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night. So I <NS type="AS"><i>wish to hear soon about you</i><c>wish to hear from you soon</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Yours <NS type="DY"><i>sincerly</i><c>sincerely</c></NS></p>

          <p>How has modern technology changed your daily life?</p>
          <p>Modern technology, such as <NS type="AGN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS>, <NS type="AGN"><i>car</i><c>cars</c></NS> and other <NS type="R"><i>else</i><c>things</c></NS>, <NS type="TV"><i>changed</i><c>have changed</c></NS> my life in many different ways <NS type="R"><i>like</i><c>such as</c></NS> communication, <NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS> and working. For example, a car, which is used <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> everyone <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>, changed my daily life in the <NS type="S"><i>sens</i><c>sense</c></NS> that I don't need my dad or my mum to go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology, but because I can show that I am <NS type="S"><i>responsable</i><c>responsible</c></NS>. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries <NS type="SX"><i>that</i><c>than</c></NS> Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Another <NS type="MQ"><c>piece of</c></NS> technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS>, <NS type="CN"><i>works</i><c>work</c></NS>, photos, but the most important <NS type="ID"><i>at my eyes</i><c>in my eyes</c></NS> is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> communication with my friends from different parts of the world <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>via</c></NS> the web. This <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>a big walk in</i><c>a big step for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. <NS type="RY"><i>At last</i><c>Finally</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the piece of</c></NS> technology that I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>bring out</i><c>emphasise</c></NS> is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or <NS type="MA"><c>something</c></NS> else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> here <NS type="MC"><c>something</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the most important in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>change</i><c>changing</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> my daily life <NS type="M"></NS>. </p>
