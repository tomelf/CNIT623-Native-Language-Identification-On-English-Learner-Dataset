          <p>For the attention <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were <NS type="R">invited to the estatement</NS> were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> his performance. In addition, the <NS type="RN"><i>event</i><c>show</c></NS> was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>were</i><c>be</c></NS> able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> the Chef who <NS type="RV"><i>leaded</i><c>runs</c></NS> the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets would be available, but <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization <NS type="R"><i>of</i><c>running</c></NS> the theatre <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>gave</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back. yours sincerely,</p>
