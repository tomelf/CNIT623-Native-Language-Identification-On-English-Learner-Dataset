          <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing to complain about your <NS type="RN"><i>entertainment</i><c>show</c></NS> which was advertised in the last edition of "Plays". I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I <NS type="RV"><i>suspected</i><c>expected</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>meet</i><c>find</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>First of all, the prices weren't <NS type="CE">lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that</NS>. Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes. Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors. <NS type="RY"><i>Especially</i><c>In particular</c></NS> I was disappointed by Danny Brook<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who made me nervous with his lack of talent.</p>
          <p>According to your advertisement, there was <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed. After that, I should also mention<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my <NS type="UJ"><i>lost</i></NS> money at once.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

          <p><NS type="RN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Come back</i><c>Comeback</c></NS></i><c>Return</c></NS> to paradise</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what <NS type="W"><i>can be designed more</i><c>more can be designed</c></NS>? Can you imagine <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> trend which <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be as shocking as <NS type="R">it has never been</NS>?</p>
          <p><NS type="UD"><i>The clothes</i><c>Clothes</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> part of each culture and one of <NS type="RD"><i>these</i><c>those</c></NS> things which <NS type="AGV"><i>expresses</i><c>express</c></NS> our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it's getting obvious that designers <NS type="TV"><i>sold</i><c>sell</c></NS> only <NS type="RN">details</NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> only the fabrics are different.</p>
          <p>People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS> clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to <NS type="RV"><i>omit</i><c>avoid</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>boredome</i><c>boredom</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I am sure that <NS type="RY"><i>at last</i><c>eventually</c></NS> we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free<NS type="MP"><i> there</i><c>. There</c></NS> won't be any problem with being up-do-date.</p>
          <p>As <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> was previously stated<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> will be <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> body and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> purity of our soul.</p>
