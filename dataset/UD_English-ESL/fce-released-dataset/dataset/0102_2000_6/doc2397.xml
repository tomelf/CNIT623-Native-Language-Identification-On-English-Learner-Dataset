          <p>DEAR "CIRCLE THEATRE" MANAGER,</p>
          <p>I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO <NS type="DV"><i>EXPRIME</i><c>EXPRESS</c></NS> MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> DIFFERENT <NS type="MA"><c>ONE</c></NS> , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15!</p>
          <p>AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE <NS type="RJ"><i>WHOLE</i><c>FULL</c></NS> PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I <NS type="RV"><i>HAD INTENTION</i><c>INTENDED</c></NS> TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. <NS type="RY"><i>EVENTUALLY</i><c>FINALLY</c></NS>, YOU PROMISED <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT <NS type="RV"><i>HAD NOT BEEN</i><c>WAS NOT</c></NS> SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.</p>
          <p>I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON,</p>
          <p>BEST WISHES</p>

          <p>FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS. BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPES</i><c>DEVELOPS</c></NS>; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) <NS type="RN"><i>STYLISTS</i><c>DESIGNERS</c></NS> FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> OPPOSITE <NS type="RT"><i>FROM</i><c>OF</c></NS> ANOTHER. I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPE</i><c>DEVELOP</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>ACCORDING TO</i><c>ALONG</c></NS> VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE <NS type="UY"><i>YET</i></NS> NOW, OR A MORE <NS type="DJ"><i>FANTASCIENTIFIC</i><c>FANTASTIC</c></NS> AND TECHNOLOGICAL <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPEMENT</i><c>DEVELOPMENT</c></NS>. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE <NS type="IV"><i>FOCALIZED</i><c>FOCUSED</c></NS> ON <NS type="DN"><i>COMFORTABILITY</i><c>COMFORT</c></NS> MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPEMENTS</i><c>DEVELOPMENTS</c></NS> OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO <NS type="RJ"><i>VARIOUS</i><c>VARIED</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>CATHEGORY</i><c>CATEGORY</c></NS>.</p>
