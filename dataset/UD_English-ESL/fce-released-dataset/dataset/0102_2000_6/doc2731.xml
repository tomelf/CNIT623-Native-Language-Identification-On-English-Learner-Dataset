          <p>The manager</p>
          <p>The Circle Theatre</p>
          <p>Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> the actors that <NS type="IV"><i>appeard</i><c>appeared</c></NS> on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets that <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be discounts <NS type="R"><i>for it</i><c>given</c></NS>, but, they didn't <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>give</c></NS> us discounts! With all <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> problems, the only thing that <NS type="ID"><i>led us</i><c>kept us going</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was <NS type="M"><c>the thought of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to eat</i><c>eating</c></NS> something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because <NS type="RN"><i>people</i><c>the staff</c></NS> didn't <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>arrived</i><c>arrive</c></NS></i><c>go</c></NS> to work that day.</p>
          <p>So it was the <NS type="IJ"><i><NS type="IJ"><i>most badly</i><c>most bad</c></NS></i><c>worst</c></NS> evening that I had ever <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS></i><c>had</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>asked</i><c>ask</c></NS> you to consider all my reasons and <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>turned back</i><c>to turn back</c></NS></i><c>to return</c></NS> my money<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I think <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> is the only thing you can do.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your <NS type="RN"><i>comprehension</i><c>understanding</c></NS></p>
