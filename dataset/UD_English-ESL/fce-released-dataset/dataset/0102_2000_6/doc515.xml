          <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
          <p>I had a <NS type="SX"><i>vary</i><c>very</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>dissappointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>evining</i><c>evening</c></NS> last <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS>. I had <NS type="S"><i>everythig</i><c>everything</c></NS> planned<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>I and my family</i><c>my family and I</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> coming to <NS type="S"><i>whatch</i><c>watch</c></NS> your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was <NS type="S"><i>disasterous</i><c>disastrous</c></NS>. Firstly there was no <NS type="W"><i>available discount</i><c>discount available</c></NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>though</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>promised</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so even my <NS type="MP"><i>6 year old</i><c>6-year-old</c></NS> son was charged <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> adult price. Then everything was going well <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30<NS type="MP"><i> well</i><c>. Well</c></NS> it didn't<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And <NS type="RP"><i>By</i><c>by</c></NS> the way may I ask you how <NS type="MP"><i>up to date</i><c>up-to-date</c></NS> your leaflets are because in spite of the <NS type="RP"><i>ad vert</i><c>advert</c></NS> saying the <NS type="DJ"><i>staring</i><c>starring</c></NS> actor was Danny Brook, <NS type="UY"><i>well</i></NS> it wasn't. It was <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor <NS type="M"><c>and one</c></NS> I had never heard of. That was a <NS type="S"><i>dissapointment</i><c>disappointment</c></NS> for my whole family<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RP"><i>infact</i><c>in fact</c></NS></i><c>. In fact</c></NS> all the <NS type="RN"><i>viewers</i><c>audience</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> very <NS type="DJ"><i>dissappointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Anyway the show was <NS type="ID"><i>nowhere as</i><c>nowhere near as</c></NS> good as it was <NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>meant</c></NS> to be and it was <NS type="S"><i>definately</i><c>definitely</c></NS> worse than I had expected it to be<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>desparately</i><c>desperately</c></NS> searching for your <NS type="FN"><i>restaurants</i><c>restaurant</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> our <NS type="S"><i>stomaches</i><c>stomachs</c></NS> rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>would</c></NS> you know<NS type="MP"><c>?</c></NS>, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no <NS type="RN"><i>problems</i><c>hesitation</c></NS> whatsoever. <NS type="RP"><i>they</i><c>They</c></NS> even gave us a table number.</p>
          <p>What kind of an <NS type="S"><i>organasation</i><c>organisation</c></NS> do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how <NS type="DJ"><i>dissappointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund.</p>
          <p><NS type="RP"><i>Thankyou</i><c>Thank you</c></NS> for your time and attention<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
          <p>Yours <NS type="RY"><i>Sincerely</i><c>Faithfully</c></NS>. </p>

          <p>The Revealed Secret</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact he was one of the <NS type="RJ"><i>main</i><c>principal</c></NS> busybodies of his <NS type="SA"><i>neighborhood</i><c>neighbourhood</c></NS> and his school so not <NS type="RP"><i>alot</i><c>a lot</c></NS> of people in his school liked him. <NS type="RP"><i>this</i><c>This</c></NS> was <NS type="R">a <NS type="SX"><i>vary</i><c>very</c></NS> bad thing about Pat's school and also for Pat</NS>. Another bad thing about this school was that there <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> different types of students that formed groups. Some <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> just <NS type="RN"><i>friend</i><c>friendship</c></NS> groups but others took it seriously, <NS type="S"><i>maby</i><c>maybe</c></NS> just a bit too seriously<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>. They</c></NS> gave themselves names and acted <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or <NS type="S"><i>mempers</i><c>members</c></NS> of other <NS type="FN"><i>gang</i><c>gangs</c></NS>, trying to start fights with them. This <NS type="S"><i>whent</i><c>went</c></NS> on and on, got more and more serious<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but it was so secret that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> teachers didn't notice.</p>
          <p>One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very <NS type="RY"><i>strictly</i><c>firmly</c></NS> to keep it a secret<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially from the other groups. But Pat was so <NS type="SX"><i>exited</i><c>excited</c></NS> that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was <NS type="S"><i>anoyed</i><c>annoyed</c></NS>, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>exept</i><c>except</c></NS> a few <NS type="S"><i>phcyco</i><c>psycho</c></NS> groups<NS type="RP"><i>, some</i><c>. Some</c></NS> of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and <NS type="DN"><i>meannes</i><c>meanness</c></NS> of it.</p>
          <p>That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves <NS type="S"><i>exept</i><c>except</c></NS> Pat<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> working. Everyone was drunk and they simply would not let him go. Time was ticking away. <NS type="RP"><i>he</i><c>He</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>new</i><c>knew</c></NS> the attack was coming <NS type="RP"><i>anyminute</i><c>any minute</c></NS>. <NS type="U"><i>now,</i></NS></p>
          <p>The time had come<NS type="MP"><i> the</i><c>. The</c></NS> <NS type="R">who</NS> groups had <NS type="S"><i>comdined</i><c>combined</c></NS> their forces and <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> ready to strike. They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready. <NS type="RP"><i>they</i><c>They</c></NS> started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone <NS type="S"><i>thew</i><c>threw</c></NS> their <NS type="FN"><i>balloon</i><c>balloons</c></NS> as far as they could. <NS type="RP"><i>they</i><c>They</c></NS> all exploded with loud splashes. The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing <NS type="W"><i>back stones</i><c>stones back</c></NS> and shooting <NS type="RP"><i>every one</i><c>everyone</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>wit</i><c>with</c></NS> BB guns. Lots of People <NS type="S"><i>wher</i><c>were</c></NS> injured and even more <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> suspended the next day at school, when the Headmaster found out what had happened.</p>
          <p>Pat <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS> no punishment at all and he wasn't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends. But he felt <NS type="DJ"><i>awfull</i><c>awful</c></NS> because he <NS type="SX"><i>new</i><c>knew</c></NS> that all this had happened because of him.</p>
