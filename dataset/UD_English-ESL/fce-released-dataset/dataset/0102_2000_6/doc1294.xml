          <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre.</p>
          <p>First of all, <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> was written in the advertisement for the show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that <NS type="UY"><i>there</i></NS> <NS type="AS"><i>would be Danny Brook as main actor</i><c>the main actor would be Danny Brook</c></NS>, but a different actor played in the show.</p>
          <p>The show started forty-five minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS> and this really disappointed me. Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> discounts for <NS type="AGN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS>, while you wrote the contrary. Moreover, I could not go to the theatre restaurant because, by the time the show had finished, it had already closed.</p>
          <p><NS type="S"><i>Definetely</i><c>Definitely</c></NS>, it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>it</c></NS> if it <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>is</c></NS> possible to have my money back.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
