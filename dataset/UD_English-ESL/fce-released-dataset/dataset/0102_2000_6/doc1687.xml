          <p>Dear Sir</p>
          <p>Last week I <NS type="RV"><i>attempted</i><c>attended</c></NS> the musical "Over the rainbow", and I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> in order to <NS type="DV"><i>complaint</i><c>complain</c></NS> about things that really disappointed me.</p>
          <p>First of all, I want to say that in the play <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> appeared a different actor <NS type="M"><c>to the one advertised,</c></NS> despite <NS type="M"><c>the fact</c></NS> that <NS type="W"><i>in the advertisement appeared the name <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> Danny Brook</i><c>the name Danny Brook appeared in the advertisement</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> that actor was very bad.</p>
          <p>Another thing I want to add is that the musical started 45 minutes late<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was <NS type="RV"><i>planned</i><c>meant</c></NS> to start at 19.30 and it really <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> at 20:15. During this time we had to keep <NS type="DJ"><i>seating</i><c>seated</c></NS> in the theatre and it was boring and tiring.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, when I bought the tickets, I asked for discounts and nobody <NS type="TV"><i>know</i><c>knew</c></NS> anything about them, so it is false <NS type="MV"><c>to say</c></NS> there are discounts available.</p>
          <p>However, we enjoyed the musical, but while going <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> to have dinner, we saw the restaurant <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> closed and we had to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> the car and come back home very hungry.</p>
          <p>It was a very disappointing evening and I hope you will give us some money back.</p>
          <p>I am waiting for your answer.</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely</p>
