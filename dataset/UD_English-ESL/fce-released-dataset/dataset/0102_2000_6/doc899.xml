          <p>Dear Sir,</p>
          <p>During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called "Over the rainbow" at The Circle Theatre. I saw an <NS type="RN"><i>advertising</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> which <NS type="M"><c>made it</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>seemed</i><c>seem</c></NS> very <NS type="S"><i>atractive</i><c>attractive</c></NS> to me.</p>
          <p>I have to say, it was not the best musical show. I think it was pretty bad. I had a very disappointing evening for many reasons.</p>
          <p><NS type="DY"><i>Firstable</i><c>Firstly</c></NS>, I decided to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> see your show to be <NS type="RV"><i>pleased</i><c>entertained</c></NS> by the <NS type="RN"><i>act</i><c>performance</c></NS> of Danny Brook <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>so</c></NS> I was <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> sad to find <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor on the stage. Another thing was the <NS type="RN"><i>hours</i><c>time</c></NS>. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's <NS type="DJ"><i>enbelievable</i><c>unbelievable</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to be</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>late <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> 45 minutes</i><c>45 minutes late</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>When I got to the <NS type="RN"><i>tickets desk</i><c>ticket office</c></NS> before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as I <NS type="TV"><i>read</i><c>had read</c></NS> on the <NS type="RN"><i>advertising</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>After the show, I went to the restaurant to have a drink after all of these disappointments, but the doors were close because of renovations.</p>
          <p>I think you will understand <NS type="MY"><c>why</c></NS> it was not "my perfect evening out" as you said, but one of the <NS type="RJ"><i>worth</i><c>worst</c></NS>. For all these reasons I am asking you to give <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back.</p>
          <p>Best Regards,</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>got</c></NS> me in <NS type="UD"><i>such</i></NS> trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed <NS type="UY"><i>together</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> a host family in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>surburb</i><c>suburb</c></NS> of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> very interesting so everything was perfect. We <NS type="W"><i>had mostly</i><c>mostly had</c></NS> a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was</c></NS> only 19 years old <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> as everyone <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> the <NS type="ID"><i>majority</i><c>age of majority</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>for <NS type="IV"><i>beeing</i><c>being</c></NS></i><c>when you are</c></NS> able to go out in the USA<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> is 21 years old. If you <NS type="UV"><i>don't</i></NS> have <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>reached</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> majority <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> even <NS type="RJ"><i>worth</i><c>worse</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> to go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> decided to go <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. At the entrance, the security guard asked for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>I've forgot</i><c>I'd forgotten</c></NS></i><c>I'd left</c></NS> it <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> home. The man said it was OK <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> this time and we <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> in quite <NS type="DY"><i>easely</i><c>easily</c></NS>, <NS type="TV"><i>we've</i><c>we'd</c></NS> made it. It was such <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>get</c></NS> thirsty. We went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the bar and <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>drink with alcohol</i><c>alcoholic drink</c></NS>. Of course by the time we <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> it we <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>had forgotten</c></NS> all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking <NS type="UA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>any time</i><c>anytime</c></NS></i></NS> 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>ending</i><c>ended</c></NS> with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping <NS type="W"><i>so well a secret</i><c>a secret so well</c></NS>!!</p>
