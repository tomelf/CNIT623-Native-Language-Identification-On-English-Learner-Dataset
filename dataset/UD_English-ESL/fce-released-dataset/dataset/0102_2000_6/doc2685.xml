          <p>Dear Sir,</p>
          <p>I'm writing to complain <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the musical show "Over the Rainbow". <NS type="TV"><i>I've been recently seeing</i><c>I recently saw</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> in your theatre during my week's holiday in London <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> London's newest and best musical show<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the best</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>had ever seen</i><c>ever see</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because of the good publicity you <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>gave</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>yourself</c></NS> in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong!</p>
          <p>Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>than</c></NS> I expected! If the <NS type="RN"><i>spectacle</i><c>show</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>had</c></NS> been beautiful, I would have been quite <NS type="RJ"><i>pleased</i><c>happy</c></NS> to wait. Then, I had read that there would <NS type="FV"><i>have been</i><c>be</c></NS> discounts available, but <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> wasn't true! <NS type="UC"><i>So it's</i><c>It's</c></NS> better not to write anything if <NS type="U"><i>you don't make</i></NS> it <NS type="MV"><c>isn't</c></NS> true <NS type="UC"><i>then</i></NS>.</p>
          <p>Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme: <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS>! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. <NS type="R"><i>Finished</i><c>After</c></NS> the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this <NS type="TV"><i>hasn't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>had been</c></NS> closed: the chef <NS type="RV"><i>went away</i><c>left</c></NS> after he received a phone call!</p>
          <p>For all these <NS type="AGN"><i>reason</i><c>reasons</c></NS>, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
          <p>A suggestion? <NS type="SA"><i>Organize</i><c>Organise</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>better your shows</i><c>your shows better</c></NS> and do not <NS type="S"><i>exagerate</i><c>exaggerate</c></NS> with publicity!</p>
          <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

          <p>There <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>could</c></NS> be many things to say about <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS>. Technology is a wide field which <NS type="RV"><i>increases</i><c>expands</c></NS> very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>can</c></NS> say <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> technology has changed our life in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> positive <NS type="MN"><c>way</c></NS> or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we <NS type="MV"><c>can</c></NS> make a phone call with an <NS type="DJ"><i>astonish</i><c>astonishing</c></NS> rapidity, <NS type="R"><i>instead</i><c>whereas</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my grandparents' time it took one month or more to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When <NS type="W"><i>appeared the first car</i><c>the first car appeared</c></NS>, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else <NS type="AGA"><i>he</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>wants</i><c>want</c></NS>! What can I say about <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> television? It allows us to <NS type="RV"><i>keep</i><c>maintain</c></NS> connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which <NS type="TV"><i>happened</i><c>have happened</c></NS> or will happen. In<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the not very <NS type="RJ"><i>far</i><c>distant</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> 1914, <NS type="AGN"><i>parent</i><c>parents</c></NS> sent their sons <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible!</p>
          <p>Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress <NS type="TV"><i>caused</i><c>has caused</c></NS> some <NS type="CN"><i>damages</i><c>damage</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the community, not only <NS type="S"><i>phisically</i><c>physically</c></NS>. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power.</p>
          <p>We <NS type="TV"><i>became</i><c>have become</c></NS> passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed. I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make <NS type="RA"><i>him</i><c>himself</c></NS> known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality.</p>
          <p>Finally, everyone should <NS type="RV"><i>decrease</i><c>slow down</c></NS> his own life's <NS type="S"><i>rythm</i><c>rhythm</c></NS>.</p>
