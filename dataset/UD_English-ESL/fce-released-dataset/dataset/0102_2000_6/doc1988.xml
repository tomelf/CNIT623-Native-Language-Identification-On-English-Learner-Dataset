          <p>Dear Sir,</p>
          <p>I would like to complain about the show which you presented <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> last <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS>. It was such <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> disappointing evening out with my friend during our <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> week's holiday in London. We have had a quite pleasant time except <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> evening. Actually it spoiled our time. So I would like to get back our money.</p>
          <p>These are some points I want <NS type="FV"><i>mention</i><c>to mention</c></NS> about the <NS type="IN"><i>differencies</i><c>differences</c></NS> between <NS type="MA"><c>what</c></NS> the advertisement said and the realities.</p>
          <p>First, I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook <NS type="FV"><i>plays</i><c>playing</c></NS> his role, but he had never shown up that night. The main actor was an unknown actor. It was <NS type="W"><i>a such</i><c>such a</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointment</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>Second, it <NS type="W"><i>started only</i><c>only started</c></NS> at 20:15. It was 45 minutes later than it <NS type="TV"><i>suppose</i><c>was supposed</c></NS> to be. It was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>such</i><c>so</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>boaring</i><c>boring</c></NS> to wait <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the show in a noisy and hot theatre.</p>
          <p>Third, there was no possibility of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount. The girl <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> sold the tickets was laughing at me when I <NS type="TV"><i>mention</i><c>mentioned</c></NS> about <NS type="MY"><c>how</c></NS> the discounts availability was written in the advertisement.</p>
          <p><NS type="SX"><i>Forth</i><c>Fourth</c></NS>, the theatre restaurant was closed. There was a <NS type="SX"><i>not</i><c>note</c></NS> on the door saying that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> painting was going on <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> weekend. How could you arrange work like that?</p>
          <p>Finally<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the sentence <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> was written <NS type="U"><i>blow down</i></NS> on the advertisement was absolutely not true. It was <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> most imperfect evening out I ever <NS type="S"><i>exprienced</i><c>experienced</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>I <NS type="RV"><i>wish</i><c>hope</c></NS> that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> back the money we paid.</p>
          <p>Sincerely</p>
          <p>Yu Phu Tung.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</p>
          <p>Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time <NS type="FV"><i>to make</i><c>making</c></NS> intimate <NS type="FN"><i>friendship</i><c>friendships</c></NS> with people around me.</p>
          <p>First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time to adjust <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="DN">multi culture</NS> in the language <NS type="S"><i>institue</i><c>institute</c></NS>. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> I could meet some friend, <NS type="UC"><i>but</i></NS> I couldn't express my <NS type="RN">heat</NS> to them <NS type="L"><i>for</i><c>because</c></NS> we have different <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>back ground</i><c>background</c></NS></i><c>backgrounds</c></NS> and our first <NS type="AGN"><i>language</i><c>languages</c></NS> were different.</p>
          <p>I really wished to have a friend <NS type="M"><c>with whom I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> share everything <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> is going <NS type="MY"><c>on</c></NS> in our lives. Finally I met Pat. She was <NS type="W"><i>a such</i><c>such a</c></NS> wonderful person in our class. She tried to help others when they <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> difficult time at school. One day she realized that I was always <NS type="UV"><i>been</i></NS> outside of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> circle.</p>
          <p>One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> weekend <NS type="S"><i>usally</i><c>usually</c></NS>. We had a fantastic time together for three <NS type="S"><i>monthes</i><c>months</c></NS>. <NS type="W"><i>Even we could</i><c>We could even</c></NS> make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books.</p>
          <p>I thought that I <NS type="MV"><c>had</c></NS> found a good friend in my life. So I told her everything about my life. There were some stories I never told anyone before, but I <NS type="TV"><i>had share</i><c>shared</c></NS> with her all my secrets.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. <NS type="MD"><i>Few</i><c>A few</c></NS> days <NS type="RY"><i>later</i><c>after</c></NS> I told her about my secret love story, it became <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> top gossip among my <NS type="FN"><i>classmate</i><c>classmates</c></NS>. It was a nightmare!</p>
