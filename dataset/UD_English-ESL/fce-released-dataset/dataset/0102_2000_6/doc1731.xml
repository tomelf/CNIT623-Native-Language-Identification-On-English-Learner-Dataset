          <p>Dear Sir or madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing to complain about the musical show called "Over the Rainbow" that was advertised in this week's newspaper.</p>
          <p>According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring <NS type="M"><c>in the show</c></NS> but it was a different actor. It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time. It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>did</c></NS> not. It started <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="S"><i>fourty five</i><c>forty five</c></NS></i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes later.</p>
          <p>And if this were not enough, I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>got</c></NS> no discount <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as was <NS type="RV"><i>written</i><c>advertised</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Beside</i><c>Besides</c></NS> this, we <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why <NS type="MV"><c>did</c></NS> you make this invitation?</p>
          <p>On top of everything, I am on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> and you can imagine how disappointed I am. It was not a perfect evening out. I suppose that you <NS type="TV"><i>are understanding</i><c>understand</c></NS> my situation, because you did not <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>tell</c></NS> the truth. I believe that you <NS type="TV"><i>will be</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>direct</i><c>directly</c></NS> to blame <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>so</c></NS> give me my money back.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully</p>
