          <p>17th June 2000</p>
          <p>The Manager</p>
          <p>The Circle Theatre</p>
          <p>My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> the funny actor "Danny Brook". When we saw your advertisement in the "Evening Post" we made a reservation.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> actors <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> been changed at the last minute.</p>
          <p>In addition, there was no discount available, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> the show started at 20:15 and not at 19:30. After that, your restaurant was closed <NS type="S"><i>whitout</i><c>without</c></NS> reason.</p>
          <p>We are very disappointed. It was not a "perfect evening out" but "a dreadful evening out".</p>
          <p>It would be nice <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> you if you could refund us some money or send us two new <NS type="AGN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
