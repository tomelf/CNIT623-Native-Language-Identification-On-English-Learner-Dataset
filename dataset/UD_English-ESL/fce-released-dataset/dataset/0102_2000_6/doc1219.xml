          <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which was <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>put on</c></NS> at The Circle Theatre last week. <NS type="S"><i>Unfortunalety</i><c>Unfortunately</c></NS> my feelings are rather bad.</p>
          <p>I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 'Over the Rainbow' musical show. The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I <NS type="S"><i>dicided</i><c>decided</c></NS> to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. <NS type="M"><i><NS type="S"><i>Especialy</i><c>Especially</c></NS></i><c>This was especially</c></NS> due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' <NS type="W"><i>even did not</i><c>did not even</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>appologize</i><c>apologize</c></NS> for this <NS type="RN"><i>range</i><c>change</c></NS>. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have <NS type="UV"><i>been</i></NS> (<NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite <NS type="DD"><i>I</i><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>am</i><c>being</c></NS> a student and the advertisement <NS type="FV"><i>said</i><c>saying</c></NS> that discounts were available, I was refused <NS type="UV"><i>to buy</i></NS> a <NS type="DJ"><i>half-a-price</i><c>half-price</c></NS> ticket, and the <NS type="S"><i>explaination</i><c>explanation</c></NS> 'why' wasn't <NS type="S"><i>sufficiant</i><c>sufficient</c></NS>. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> according to the advertisement<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> ought to <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even <NS type="S"><i>angier</i><c>angrier</c></NS>. There was no information <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> why it was closed and if it would be open at all.</p>
          <p>The advertisement <NS type="AGV"><i>say</i><c>says</c></NS> 'your perfect evening out'<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> me my money back.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> on Friday almost half of my class knew <NS type="TV"><i>what's</i><c>what was</c></NS> going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I <NS type="TV"><i>would pass</i><c>passed</c></NS> the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I <NS type="TV"><i>hope</i><c>hoped</c></NS> that nobody <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>was</c></NS> watching me. Unfortunately<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The <NS type="S"><i>instractur</i><c>instructor</c></NS> opened the car <NS type="MN"><c>door</c></NS> and asked me to sit <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="MP"><i>drivers</i><c>driver's</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>sit</i><c>seat</c></NS>. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very <NS type="S"><i>ofen</i><c>often</c></NS> crossing the white line on the road. I looked <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the mirror and I saw how my friends were <NS type="S"><i>lauthing</i><c>laughing</c></NS>. It made <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> crazy. I started doing stupid things: <NS type="FV"><i>turn</i><c>turning</c></NS> right instead of left and so on.</p>
          <p><NS type="MD"><i>Next</i><c>The next</c></NS> day, I decided that I <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. <NS type="RY">Eventually</NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> things weren't so bad. I went to school and everyone was very friendly. Pat <NS type="S"><i>appologized</i><c>apologized</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me for not keeping <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> secrets. At the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> I was very angry but in the end I said that everything <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> O.K.</p>
          <p>We are good friends nowadays<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I will never tell her my secrets.</p>
