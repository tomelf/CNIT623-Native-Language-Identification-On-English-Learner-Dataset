          <p>Dear Manager,</p>
          <p>I saw your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> your show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>First the <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show, Over the Rainbow<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> started at 20:15, and in the advertisement <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was written <NS type="M"><c>that it would start</c></NS> at 19:30<NS type="RP"><i>, then</i><c>. Then</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>also was</i><c>was also</c></NS> written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show <NS type="W"><i>appeared a different actor</i><c>a different actor appeared</c></NS>, that was really disappointing. Also <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was written in the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> that some discounts were available, but there <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> discounts. And because of the time that the show started I couldn't <NS type="TV"><i>went</i><c>go</c></NS> to the theatre restaurant because it was closed.</p>
          <p><NS type="R"><i>Mr</i><c>Sir</c></NS>, I was very disappointed with the show so I want my money back, and I am sure you will understand my reasons.</p>
          <p>Yours Faithfully,</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to <NS type="RV"><i>speak</i><c>talk</c></NS> about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="SA"><i>kilometer</i><c>kilometre</c></NS></i><c>kilometres</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>distance</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> Earth and <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>then</c></NS> I was so ashamed because I have been <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>her</c></NS> boyfriend since I <NS type="TV"><i>have came</i><c>came</c></NS> to Earth.</p>
          <p>My confession caused a disaster in <NS type="R"><i>the life of her and</i><c>her life and that of</c></NS> her family, and they called the police to take me <NS type="RY"><i>out</i><c>off</c></NS> of the planet or <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> arrested, so that I <NS type="TV"><i>can't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> see her again.</p>
          <p>The police caught me, when I was peacefully in my room, and put me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> covered with something, in a car. After they caught me I think they brought me to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Area 57, <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> the police do experiments.</p>
          <p>Since then I <NS type="TV"><i>live</i><c>have lived</c></NS> in Area 57, and this is my diary <NS type="UN"><i>life</i></NS>. I don't now when I <NS type="R"><i>and</i><c>am</c></NS> going to be free<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> to my planet.</p>
