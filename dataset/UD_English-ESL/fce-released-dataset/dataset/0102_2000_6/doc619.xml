          <p>Dear Manager,</p>
          <p>I am writing to complain about the Musical Show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> last week. There is some disagreement <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> between your advertisement and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which I <NS type="TV"><i>could see</i><c>saw</c></NS> at the Circle Theatre.</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>indicate</i><c>state</c></NS> that you <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>gave</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> wrong starting and finishing <NS type="RN"><i>hours</i><c>times</c></NS>. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>stated</c></NS>. It was very surprising for me and I had <NS type="UV"><i>got</i></NS> a lot of trouble with <NS type="RV"><i>coming</i><c>getting</c></NS> back home at night - when it finished.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage. <NS type="AGA"><i>She</i><c>He</c></NS> is my <NS type="RJ"><i>famous</i><c>favourite</c></NS> artist and I <NS type="TV"><i>was <NS type="RV"><i>coming</i><c>going</c></NS></i><c>went</c></NS> there mainly because of him. <NS type="UC"><i>If this</i><c>This</c></NS> made me really disappointed - he wasn't <NS type="RV"><i>playing</i><c>performing</c></NS> there.</p>
          <p>Another point<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I want you to consider<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> restaurant. The place you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> anything to eat?</p>
          <p>Finally, you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>advertised</i><c>claimed</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I would have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for <NS type="UV"><i>giving</i></NS> my money back. I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> this could be the only<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> right <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>way</c></NS> for me<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> to forget about my <NS type="DJ"><i>not interesting</i><c>uninteresting</c></NS> evening.</p>
          <p>I would appreciate it<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if you could consider my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully</p>

          <p>FASHION OF THE FUTURE</p>
          <p>Try to imagine<NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and <NS type="W"><i><NS type="SX"><i>shinny</i><c>shiny</c></NS> large</i><c>large shiny</c></NS> shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes <NS type="U"><i>on them</i></NS>. It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books. It's a REALITY, <NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS> the FASHION OF THE FUTURE...</p>
          <p>People <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>have been</c></NS> wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything <NS type="TV"><i>was changing</i><c>has changed</c></NS>: style, colour<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>qual</i><c>quality</c></NS>. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>nowadays</i><c>now</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>have been</c></NS> the main point of many fashion <NS type="RN">creatures</NS>. What can we suspect then? What <NS type="R">something new</NS> hasn't been invented <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> now? I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>tell</c></NS></i><c>will tell</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>it to</i></NS> you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the <NS type="RJ"><i>nearest</i><c>next</c></NS> 100 years.</p>
          <p>The climate is changing, so we <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> there will be times<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when women <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> like <NS type="W"><i>to be again</i><c>again to be</c></NS> thought <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> delicate and <NS type="RJ"><i>sensible</i><c>sensitive</c></NS> human beings. Showing their figure, they would have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>no</c></NS> exhibitionism! We have too many <NS type="DJ">taken off</NS> people around us, now. And <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> will be <NS type="M"><c>a thing of</c></NS> the past. <NS type="MD"><i>Streets</i><c>The streets</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 21st century will be smart.</p>
          <p>So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very <NS type="RJ">poor</NS>. This fashion is coming, so think about it.</p>
          <p>Grey and black - like <NS type="R"><i>weather</i><c>the</c></NS> seasons, like <NS type="MP"><i>people</i><c>people's</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>charakters</i><c>characters</c></NS>, like all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> night and dark <NS type="S"><i>sourranding</i><c>surrounding</c></NS> us. These are the colours of the FUTURE.</p>
