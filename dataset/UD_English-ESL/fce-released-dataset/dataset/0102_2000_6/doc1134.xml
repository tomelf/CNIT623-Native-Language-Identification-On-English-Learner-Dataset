          <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing to express my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the musical show I <NS type="TV"><i>had seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> yesterday, called 'Over The Rainbow'.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I was <NS type="S"><i>disapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS>, because the actor Danny Brook did not <NS type="TV"><i>appeared</i><c>appear</c></NS> in the show. Then, another thing I would like to mention is that the time advertised was wrong, because the show started at 20:15.</p>
          <p>Another thing is that there were discounts on the price of the tickets, and I did not <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> any discount. <NS type="R">It</NS> also <NS type="RV"><i>puts</i><c>states</c></NS> that there was a restaurant to eat in after the show, but it was closed because it was not completely built.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to know why <NS type="M"></NS> would have a perfect evening, because I did not have one, so I would like to have my money back.</p>
          <p>I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
          <p>Juan Almo Dali</p>
