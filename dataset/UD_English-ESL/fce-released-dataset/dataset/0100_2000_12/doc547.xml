          <p>A DAY <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>IN</c></NS> MY LIFE</p>
          <p>It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.</p>
          <p>That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again. I was afraid <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>doing</i><c>to do</c></NS> it but I had to do it. It was the first time I had robbed a bank. I was her best friend. I promised her <NS type="M"><c>I would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to find</i><c>find</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> money for her operation. She was at the hospital and she was really bad.</p>
          <p><NS type="MT"><i>That</i><c>At that</c></NS> time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> cashier to give me all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> money. Before I took <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> money one of the <NS type="AGN"><i>cashier</i><c>cashiers</c></NS> had pressed a button to call <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> police. I quickly left <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> bank.</p>
          <p>However, it didn't take long <NS type="R"><i>that they</i><c>for them</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>caught</i><c>to catch</c></NS> me <NS type="UY"><i>soon</i></NS>. The policeman arrested me and I <NS type="RV"><i>stayed</i><c>was</c></NS> in <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> prison for 15 years. The worst thing was my friend died <NS type="W"><i>after 10 days</i><c>10 days after</c></NS> I was arrested.</p>
