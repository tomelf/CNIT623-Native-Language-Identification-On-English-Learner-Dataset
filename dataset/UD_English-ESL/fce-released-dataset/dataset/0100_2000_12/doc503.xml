         <coded_answer>
          <p> Nowadays, in our society, there are some people who, because of their work or because of their success in life, <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> become popular, and by now <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> known by everybody. But, how does fame affect <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> their lifestyle?</p>
          <p>Politicians, musicians or film <NS type="RN"><i>starts</i><c>stars</c></NS> are <NS type="RV"><i>controlled</i><c>watched</c></NS> all the time, <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>when</c></NS> they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do.</p>
          <p>It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> go to shows<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to <NS type="RV"><i>pay</i><c>buy</c></NS></i><c>will buy</c></NS> that.</p>
          <p>But obviously, if these people are all the time in the newspaper, on TV and so on, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is because, although we don't want to accept it, we love following their <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS>.</p>
          <p>So now, all we should have to ask ourselves is if their <NS type="RJ">damaged</NS> <NS type="FN"><i>lifestyles</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS> is in part our fault.</p>
