          <p>It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.</p>
          <p>Whenever I <NS type="S"><i>recollet</i><c>recollect</c></NS> it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Army, I was able to apply to <NS type="M"><c>join the</c></NS> Korea Auxiliary Police.</p>
          <p>One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul. Suddenly, the <NS type="RN"><i>theft signal</i><c>burglar alarm</c></NS> came <NS type="RY"><i>into</i><c>on</c></NS>. So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly. When we arrived at the place <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>where</c></NS> it happened, one man started running away. Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow. Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg. He fell down and we had to stare at each other. After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him. As a result, I could go on vacation. When I <NS type="RV"><i>said to</i><c>told</c></NS> my mother, she asked me not to do it again.</p>
          <p>But, I was a <NS type="UP"><i>police-man</i><c>policeman</c></NS>. Therefore, I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous.</p>
