          <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
          <p>I am writing with reference to your <NS type="RN"><i>advertisement</i><c>article</c></NS> which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> your article.</p>
          <p>First of all, your <NS type="RN"><i>advertisement</i><c>article</c></NS> mentions that the course had to be cancelled<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> because the teacher was ill, but the course <NS type="TV"><i>cancelled</i><c>was cancelled</c></NS> only <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that <NS type="RP"><i>no body</i><c>nobody</c></NS> registered for the local history course. <NS type="UC"><i>So</i></NS> I would like to inform you that 32 attended <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses <NS type="M"><c>are concerned</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for <NS type="W"><i>being these courses</i><c>these courses being</c></NS> so popular is that people are very interested in these <NS type="FN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of activities. Apart from this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the teachers <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> very experienced and the equipment was <NS type="S"><i>particullarly</i><c>particularly</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><NS type="S"><i>coteporary</i><c>contemporary</c></NS></NS>.</p>
          <p><NS type="S"><i>Furthemore</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention.</p>
          <p><NS type="DY"><i>Finaly</i><c>Finally</c></NS>, I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention <NS type="SX"><i>bud</i><c>but</c></NS> I would like to thank you for <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> kind attention to my letter, and I would like you to write another article which will <NS type="DV"><i>lit to</i><c>tell</c></NS> the truth</p>
          <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

          <p>Dear Jane,</p>
          <p>I am very happy because I <NS type="TV"><i>haven't received</i><c>hadn't received</c></NS> any letter from you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> serious <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS>, I didn't write to you. I hope you are fine.</p>
          <p>First of all, you <NS type="S"><i>musn't</i><c>mustn't</c></NS> panic. It's not <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been <NS type="DV"><i>offed</i><c>offered</c></NS> two jobs. In my opinion<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a <NS type="RV"><i>place</i><c>job</c></NS> in a restaurant.</p>
          <p>If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should <NS type="RV"><i>wonder</i><c>consider</c></NS> which <NS type="DN"><i>working place</i><c>workplace</c></NS> is more convenient <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you. You'd <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum <NS type="MV"><c>may</c></NS> include big tips from the tourists. Apart from <NS type="RA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS>, despite the fact that it is a summer job<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you could be employed for the whole <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> next year, if you are lucky.</p>
          <p><NS type="ID"><i>Last but not last</i><c>Last but not least</c></NS>, I hope you will find my opinion helpful<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>wish</i><c>hope</c></NS> your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> a problem. Whatever choice you <NS type="TV"><i>will make</i><c>make</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'm sure it will be the best for you. Drop me a line.</p>
          <p>Lots of <NS type="RP"><i>Love</i><c>love</c></NS>,</p>
