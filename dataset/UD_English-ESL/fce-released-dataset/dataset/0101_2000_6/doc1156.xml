But I could <NS type="S"><i>se</i><c>see</c></NS> that his face was happy and he <NS type="TV"><i>didn't tell</i><c>wasn't telling</c></NS> lies. I stopped talking to my friends and I followed him. We started walking and walking. When we arrived at the <NS type="UP"><i>bus-station</i><c>bus station</c></NS> I couldn't understand why he wanted to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> there. But I didn't ask him. We <NS type="TV"><i>wait</i><c>waited</c></NS> there for an hour, and I was really angry. I wanted <NS type="S"><i>t</i><c>to</c></NS> know why we were there.</p>
          <p>At that moment we saw the bus <NS type="FV"><i>to come</i><c>come</c></NS>, it stopped and one man <NS type="TV"><i>come</i><c>came</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i>sit</i><c>sat</c></NS> near <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> us. I <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>recognise</i><c>recognised</c></NS> him. He was my father. I couldn't <NS type="S"><i>beleive</i><c>believe</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to see</i><c>seen</c></NS> him for five years. I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> that I was dreaming but I wasn't. It was true<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> my father <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>had</c></NS> come <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> his country after five years.</p>
          <p>Now all the problems will finish and we will start a new life.</p>
