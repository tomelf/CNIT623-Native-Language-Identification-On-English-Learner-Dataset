<p>I hope this letter will be enough to explain why I want to do this trip .</p>
<p>First of all , I think I 'm going to be busy on the 4th of April .</p>
<p>Can we change the date into the 5th of April , at 4 o'clock ?</p>
<p>I 'll leave it to you .</p>
<p>By the way , if you tell me around what time you will be back on the 20th , maybe I can prepare something for dinner .</p>
<p>Last of all , thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present .</p>
<p>I am very interested in meeting and spending time with people from other cultures .</p>
<p>I may need to use particularly the computer and the CD player .</p>
<p>Dear Pete ,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for letting me use your things during the stay .</p>
<p>I know you have a good taste in presents ! !</p>
<p>I know you 're going to be too tired to cook after 11 hours of flight .</p>
<p>Obviously a sailing trip has not got the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting .</p>
<p>With regards to your advertisement in " The Traveller " magazine , I would be pleased to tell you why I want to apply for this trip .</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too .</p>
<p>I hope you have a fantastic time in New York and please do n't worry about your flat .</p>
<p>To whom it may concern ,</p>
<p>Have a great time in the States .</p>
<p>Everything is going to be under control !</p>
<p>Anything as a souveniere would be quite enough for me .</p>
<p>Is that OK for you ?</p>
<p>Love ,</p>
<p>I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real life and having friends from all over the world will help me to think " worldwide " .</p>
<p>The first thing that caught my attention in the advert was " ... eight people from different countries ... " .</p>
<p>But I want to make some points clear before you leave London .</p>
