<p>the first attention that caught my advert from The thing was " ... eight people in different countries ... " .</p>
<p>I am very interested from spending and meeting time with people in other cultures .</p>
<p>I am generally known as an calm emergency and I can remain reliable in the person situations and I am too easy-going quite .</p>
