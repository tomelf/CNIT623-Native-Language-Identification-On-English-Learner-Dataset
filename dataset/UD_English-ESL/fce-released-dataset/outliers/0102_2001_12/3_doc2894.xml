<p>people answer one But can each one of these simple question !</p>

<p>say : I I can honestly could .</p>
<p>it but luckily become a TV , I watch I like TV I have n't addict yet .</p>
<p>Well , maybe only yet .</p>
<p>When do we turn on our TV set ?</p>
<p>bored and lonely When we are contrary when we doing something we or on the are tired of dislike .</p>
