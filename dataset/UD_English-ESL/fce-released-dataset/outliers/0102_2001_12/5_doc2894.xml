<p>Dear John !</p>
<p>TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day , unable to press the " Off " button on the remote control .</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply ,</p>
<p>In my opinion a guided tour is essential , because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions .</p>
<p>I like TV , I watch it but luckily I have n't become a TV addict yet .</p>
<p>I think you should definetly go and I 'll try to help in what I can .</p>
<p>I really enjoyed our trip and I 'm eager to see you again !</p>
<p>And no , it was n't a self-made torture .</p>
<p>First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat .</p>
<p>I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable .</p>
<p>I advise you to try watersports as well , it 's a real laugh .</p>
<p>The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living .</p>
<p>So if I lived without television for a week I 'd find something else to keep me busy : invite some friends around , read a good interesting book , go bowling or to a swimming pool .</p>
<p>How is your sister , Marine ?</p>
<p>" Could you live without television for a week ? "</p>
<p>This summer I lived three weeks in a complete TV vacuum , I forgot it had ever existed .</p>
<p>It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip .</p>
<p>I was very happy to receive your letter .</p>
<p>I think everyone can say " no " to TV because humans ' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave .</p>
<p>By the way , I 'd love to come with you , if it 's possible !</p>
<p>And it 'll be good for you as well , after a week without TV you 'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more .</p>
<p>And the radio ( if you 're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them to be read to you ! )</p>
<p>I think you should take packed lunch with you , because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small ( you 'll get very tired walking around the castle ) .</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>I was just having a good time and I did n't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings .</p>
<p>But can each one of these people answer one simple question !</p>
<p>When do we turn on our TV set ?</p>
<p>I have n't heard from you for a long time , how are you ?</p>
<p>You might ask me a normal question " What about news ? "</p>
<p>We were also very lucky with the weather , it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long .</p>
<p>I just did n't have time for it , did n't allow it to enter my life .</p>
<p>I 'm not sure how many students are there in your class but they give reductions for groups over 15 people so maybe you 'll have to invite some friends to join you .</p>
<p>Well , I 'm also bothered about what 's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers ?</p>
<p>Well , maybe only yet .</p>
<p>When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike .</p>
<p>I can honestly say : I could .</p>
<p>Some say it 's evil , it spoils our eyes and personality , others say it 's useful , enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality .</p>
