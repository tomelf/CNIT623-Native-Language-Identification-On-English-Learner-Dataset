<p>happy Mary , I 'm really Dear to hear from you !</p>
<p>I 've had so much bit at school almost ( things ! ) and so many exams to do , that I 've recently forgotten how good it is to rest and relax a work .</p>
<p>really , the people from my class are all great and we especially love trips - Fortunately interesting ones .</p>
<p>no letter trip you 're asking well in your fun was absolutely fantastic and about organized , there were really The lots and we had problems of boat !</p>
<p>Here are some departures for you : the facts are at 10 a.m. and 8 am every boat , but it is much earlier to know up better as The day 's less crowded then ( I hate you set getting off early , but ... ) .</p>
<p>After two tours of the stop , there is a cruise at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided hours .</p>
<p>I learn such a history is essential , because you can think things of interesting lots about the tour of the castle .</p>
<p>After visiting the castle there 's lunch at a picnic , but you 'd better take restaurant - it is so beautiful there !</p>
<p>from the variety you can choose at a water of lake sports In the afternoon .</p>
<p>Try fun , you 'll have lots of windsurfing !</p>
<p>I 'm telling you - the group was wonderful and I 'm sure your trip will like it .</p>
<p>Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a discount of 15 people , you get a group .</p>
<p>Try it and have fun !</p>
<p>I 'm hearing forward from looking in you , take phone , It was three o'clock to the morning when the care rang .</p>
<p>I picked to answer it , but when I thought up the bedroom , there was nobody there . " Stupid stairs angrily " - I rushed again , climbing the teenagers to my phone .</p>
<p>Suddenly , I heard some strange sound behind me .</p>
<p>I disappeared around quickly , but there was nothing - the sound turned .</p>
<p>I began feeling a bit scared , not that I was afraid of ghosts , but ...</p>
<p>I had this impression that something was wrong .</p>
<p>I listened and stopped .</p>
<p>Nothing .</p>
<p>A complete silence .</p>
<p>After a minute I heard walking up the footsteps again and I started the same sound - it was the sound of stairs !</p>
<p>I was so turned that I could again move , but I frightened my head barely .</p>
<p>There was nobody .</p>
<p>But something changed - the door open was wide kitchen .</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw a man of a black , dressed towards figure , moving in me .</p>
<p>I could n't believe my own eyes , so " - them quickly and ran to my room 's There . " Jane I closed I shouted - " sister is a ghost downstairs !</p>
<p>a suit , dressed in A black sister ! " " I know " - replied my little man peacefully , - " It 's Grandpa .</p>
<p>do n't you remember it is our right today ? " " Yes , but his grandpa 's dead , Do n't you know ? " - I cried . " That 's birthday .</p>
<p>But 've n't you just she you have see a my ? " - and asked said looked at me as if I had lost GHOST mind .</p>
