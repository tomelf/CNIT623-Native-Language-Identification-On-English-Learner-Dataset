<p>In the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake .</p>
<p>Try it and have fun !</p>
<p>After visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant , but you 'd better take picnic - it 's so beautiful there !</p>
<p>Suddenly , I heard some strange sound behind me .</p>
<p>Try windsurfing , you 'll have lots of fun !</p>
<p>It was three o'clock in the morning when the phone rang .</p>
<p>Fortunately , the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones .</p>
<p>I rushed to answer it , but when I picked up the phone , there was nobody there .</p>
<p>" Yes , but our grandpa is dead , do n't you remember ? " - I cried .</p>
<p>But something changed - the kitchen door was wide open .</p>
<p>A man , dressed in a black suit ! "</p>
<p>The boat trip you 're asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized , there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun !</p>
<p>Dear Mary ,</p>
<p>I 'm really happy to hear from you !</p>
<p>There was nobody .</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw a figure of a man , dressed in black , moving towards me .</p>
<p>Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people , you get a discount .</p>
<p>Do n't you know it 's his birthday today ? "</p>
<p>A complete silence .</p>
<p>" Stupid teenagers again " - I thought angrily , climbing the stairs to my bedroom .</p>
<p>I was so frightened that I could barely move , but I turned my head again .</p>
<p>I 'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I 'm sure your group will like it .</p>
<p>After two hours of the cruise , there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours .</p>
<p>I began feeling a bit scared , not that I was afraid of ghosts , but ... I had this impression that something was wrong .</p>
<p>Nothing .</p>
<p>I 'm looking forward to hearing from you , take care ,</p>
<p>Here are some facts for you :</p>
<p>But have n't you just said you 've see a GHOST ? " - she asked and looked at me as if I had lost my mind .</p>
<p>I could n't believe my own eyes , so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister 's room .</p>
<p>" I know " - replied my little sister peacefully , - " It 's Grandpa .</p>
<p>" Jane " - I shouted - " There is a ghost downstairs !</p>
<p>I 've had so much work at school recently ( exams ! ) and so many things to do , that I 've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit .</p>
<p>After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps !</p>
<p>I think such a tour is essential , because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle .</p>
<p>I turned around quickly , but there was nothing - the sound disappeared .</p>
<p>The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day , but it 's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then ( I know you hate getting up early , but ... ) .</p>
<p>I stopped and listened .</p>
<p>" That 's right .</p>
