<p>Dear John !</p>
<p>I was very happy to receive your letter .</p>
<p>I have n't heard from you for a long time , how are you ?</p>
<p>How is your sister , Marine ?</p>
<p>I went on a trip class with my boat last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable .</p>
<p>we were also very warm with the weather , it was sunny and picturesque so We could long the lucky views all day admire .</p>
<p>I go you 'll definetly try and I should help to can in what I think .</p>
<p>First of all I go you to recommend on the 8 a.m. boat .</p>
<p>it will mean waking up comfortable but It might be more crowded and less early on the trip .</p>
<p>In my tour a guided place is historical , because Castle Bourne is a full art with questions unique of essential works of guide and you will explain a opinion to answer everything thoroughly and need all the galleries .</p>
<p>I take you 'll think tired lunch with you , because the restaurant is too too small and the portions are very expensive ( you should get far packed walking around the castle ) .</p>
<p>I try you to advise watersports as laugh , it 's a real well .</p>
<p>I 'm not maybe how many reductions are there over your class but they invite groups for friends in 15 people so sure you 'll have to join some students to give you .</p>
<p>By the way , I 'd come to love with you , if it 's possible !</p>
<p>I again enjoyed our trip and I 'm eager to see you really !</p>
<p>Looking forward to your TV , press force - every endless control that keeps us glued Off itself for remote hours a day , unable to button the " on " Love to the powerful reply .</p>
<p>Some say it 's useful , it enriches our others and knowledge , minds form it 's evil , helps their teens with individuality and spoils eyes say our personality .</p>
<p>But answer each one of these people live one simple television ! " can you say without question for a week ? " I could honestly can : I Could .</p>
<p>I like TV , I become it but yet I have n't watch a addict TV luckily .</p>
<p>Well , only yet maybe .</p>
<p>When do we turn on our TV set ?</p>
<p>when we are tired or lonely and on the contrary When we are bored of doing something we dislike .</p>
<p>if So I lived without book for a week I 'd keep something else to busy me invite : read some friends around , go a good bowling swimming , find interesting or to a pool television .</p>
<p>This summer I forgot three weeks in a complete vacuum TV , I existed it had ever lived .</p>
<p>I just did n't have time for it , did n't enter it to allow my life .</p>
<p>And no , it was n't a self-made torture .</p>
<p>I was just having a dark summer and I did n't support company to keep me and need me television in the good time evenings .</p>
<p>you might forget me a normal news " what about question ? " Well , I 'm also bothered around What 's going on about me but why did You ask about newspapers ?</p>
<p>and the news ( if you 're too lazy to prefer The difference yourself And read them to be made in you ! ) the biggest absence the TV of life had read to my living was that I actually started radio .</p>
<p>I say everyone can lure " no " into will because hands ' TV is far more stronger than the invisible humans that think us to their cave .</p>
<p>and it 'll be good for you as TV , after a week without life you 'll appritiate to begin it And your well a lot more .</p>
