<p>You must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs .</p>
<p>Also working in a museum include big tips from the tourists .</p>
<p>Last but not last , I hope you will find my opinion helpful I wish your problem will be solved , but I do n't think that it 's about a problem .</p>
<p>Yours faithfully ,</p>
<p>First of all , you mus n't panic .</p>
<p>Thirdly , as far as the painting and photography courses is true what you say , they were very popular .</p>
<p>I think that the reason for being these courses so popular is that people are very interested in these kind of activities .</p>
<p>So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course .</p>
<p>But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you .</p>
<p>I hope you are fine .</p>
<p>Apart from these , despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole next year , if you are lucky .</p>
<p>Drop me a line .</p>
<p>You 'd better not to travel far away from your home .</p>
<p>Whatever choice you will make I 'm sure it will be the best for you .</p>
<p>That is not true .</p>
<p>Furthemore , your article mentions that the weekend cost over£100 .</p>
<p>Finaly , I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention bud I would like to thank you for you kind attention to my letter , and I would like you to write another article which will lit to the truth</p>
<p>Secondly , you mention that no body registered for the local history course .</p>
<p>Dear Jane ,</p>
<p>Last but not least , the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term , so it will be sooner than you mention .</p>
<p>It 's not serious enough problem to get upset .</p>
<p>As I took part in this activities weekend , which was organised by the college , I would like to express my dissatisfaction to your article .</p>
<p>I am very happy because I have n't received any letter from you , for long time , and as I had a problem with my mother 's health , not serious , I did n't write to you .</p>
<p>Lots of Love ,</p>
<p>First of all , your advertisement mentions that the course had to be cancelled , because the teacher was ill , but the course cancelled only the last afternoon .</p>
<p>Apart from this the teachers was very experienced and the equipment was particullarly coteporary .</p>
<p>Now I do n't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant .</p>
<p>In my opinion as you 're really very keen on history , I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum .</p>
<p>If I were in your shoes , I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same , I think that this choice is the best for you .</p>
<p>The cost was only£60 including lunch .</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam ,</p>
<p>I am writing with reference to your advertisement which I read in a local newspaper two days ago .</p>
