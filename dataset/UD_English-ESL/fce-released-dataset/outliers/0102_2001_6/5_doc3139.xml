<p>I had never had a birthday party before and I did n't expect much .</p>
<p>The party was far beyound my expectation .</p>
<p>I was born in May , which is the busiest month for school teachers in Japan .</p>
<p>In my childhood , they were always too busy to remember my birthday and I did n't remember my birthday either .</p>
<p>At the event , I 'd like you to give us a speech .</p>
<p>I still often forget my birthday , but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago .</p>
<p>You can tell us about whatever you like .</p>
<p>Most of the students are between 18 and 22 years old , but there are some elder , the eldest is 28 years old .</p>
<p>Our English club is not a very big one , with 14 students and a teacher .</p>
<p>Unfortunately , both of my parents are teachers .</p>
<p>We all love to learn English .</p>
<p>20 people from five different countries celebrated for me .</p>
<p>For example , a speech about your latest work would be very nice .</p>
<p>I had never felt happier .</p>
<p>My name is Akihiro and I 'm a member of an English club at West Isle College .</p>
<p>On that day , I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday.</p>
<p>After the event , I 'd like to offer you a dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college .</p>
<p>I 'm writing this letter to invite you to the event which I 'm organizing for people who want to improve their English , as our teacher told me that you have come to live in our area .</p>
<p>When I was 23 , I joined a NGO in Denmark and stared living with other members , most of who are from Europe .</p>
<p>I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Belinda Marriott ,</p>
<p>Sincerely yours ,</p>
<p>I had never taken birthdays serious , both my own and of others , until I had that really special day on my twenty-fourth birthday .</p>
<p>I 'm planning the event on 15 or 22 February , from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you .</p>
