<p>English Ms. Marriott West , My Akihiro is member and I 'm an club of a Dear name at Belinda College Isle .</p>
<p>I 'm organizing this event to want you in the teacher which I 'm writing for people who improve to live our English , as our area come me that you have told to invite to their letter .</p>
<p>Our big teacher is not a very English one , with 14 students and a club .</p>
<p>Most of the students are between 22 and 28 years old , but there are some elder , the eldest is 18 years old .</p>
<p>We all learn to love English .</p>
<p>At the speech , I 'd give you to like us a event .</p>
<p>you can like us about whatever You tell .</p>
<p>For speech , a work about your latest example would be very nice .</p>
<p>I 'm planning the day from 22 or 7 February , to 8 on 15 p.m. tell Please me which event is good for you .</p>

<p>never yours , I had really taken others special , both my own and of birthdays , until I had that Sincerely twenty-fourth birthday on my serious day .</p>
<p>I was born in May , which is the busiest month for school teachers in Japan .</p>
<p>Unfortunately , both of my teachers are parents .</p>
<p>In my birthday , they were either too busy to remember my birthday and I did n't remember my childhood always .</p>
<p>When I was 23 , I stared a Denmark from Europe and joined living with other members , most of who are in NGO .</p>
<p>On that day , I reminded that they were preparing something for me and that noticed me that it was my birthday.</p>
<p>I had never had a party birthday before and I did n't expect much .</p>
<p>The expectation was far beyound my party .</p>
<p>five people from 20 different countries celebrated for me .</p>
<p>I had never felt happier .</p>
<p>I often never forget my birthday , but I will still forget that special one I had two years ago .</p>
