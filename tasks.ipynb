    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    ">UD English-ESL/TLE is a collection of 5,124 English as a Second Language (ESL) sentences (97,681 words), manually annotated with POS tags and dependency trees in the Universal Dependencies formalism. Each sentence is annotated both in its original and error corrected forms. The annotations follow the standard English UD guidelines, along with a set of supplementary guidelines for ESL. The dataset represents upper-intermediate level adult English learners from 10 native language backgrounds, with over 500 sentences for each native language. The sentences were randomly drawn from the Cambridge Learner Corpus First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus. The treebank is split randomly to a training set of 4,124 sentences, development set of 500 sentences and a test set of 500 sentences. Further information is available at [esltreebank.org](esltreebank.org). \n",

    "### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    ">Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)\n",

    "The BI-LSTM model is derived from Bidrectional RNN (BRNN) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997).\n",

    ">The principle of BRNN is to split the neurons of a regular RNN into two directions, one for positive time direction (forward states), and another for negative time direction (backward states). Those two states‚Äô output are not connected to inputs of the opposite direction states. By using two time directions, input information from the past and future of the current time frame can be used unlike standard RNN which requires the delays for including future information.

Although it might not be the best choice (e.g. Google News corpus might not be representative for the English Learner text), it's still a legitimate choice: 1) It saves my time to build a large dictionary which cover all words in the UD English-ESL/TLE corpus; 2) It saves my time and computing resources to build large/sparse unigram vectors for words, and I don't need to worry about dimension reduction for now; 3) 300-dim w2v vector is small enough for this task, and the dimension is fixed so the vector can be directly used in NN. 4) It's free and available on Google Drive :).
